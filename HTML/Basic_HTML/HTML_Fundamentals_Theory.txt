What are Div Elements and When Should You Use Them?

The div element is used as a container to group other elements.

Here is an example of a div element. Add another paragraph element inside of the div element and see the changes in the preview window. To see the previews, you will need to enable the interactive editor.

<div>
  <p>Example paragraph element.</p>

</div>
You will mainly use the div element when you want to group HTML elements that will share a set of CSS styles. You will learn more about CSS in future lessons and workshops.

Even though the div element is commonly used in real world codebases, you should be careful not to overuse it. There are times when another element would be more appropriate.

For example, if you wanted divide up your content into sections, then the section element would be more appropriate than a div element.

Add another section element below the first one. Then inside of the section element, a h2 and p elements. You can use whatever text you like and you will see the changes in the preview window. To interact with the example, you will need to enable the interactive editor.

<section>
  <h2>Mammals</h2>
  <p>Mammals are warm-blooded animals with fur or hair. Most give birth to live young.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lion</li>
    <li>Elephant</li>
    <li>Dolphin</li>
  </ul>
</section>
The section element has semantic meaning over the div element which is not semantic. Semantics are the meaning of words or phrases in a language. In HTML, which is a language, elements have their own semantic meaning too. So, this means if you use a section element, the browser will pick up its semantic meaning and understand to treat this as a section - on desktops, mobiles, you name it. 

What semantic meaning does a div element have? The div element has no semantic meaning.

When is it most appropriate to use a div element in your HTML? When grouping related content for styling purposes.

Which of the following HTML elements is commonly used to group content into distinct sections? section

What Are IDs and Classes, and When Should You Use Them?

The id attribute adds a unique identifier to an HTML element.

Here is an example of an h1 element with an id of title.

Below the h1 element, add an h2 element with an id set to "subtitle". You can write whatever text you like for the h2 and you will see the changes in the preview window. To interact with the example, you will need to enable the interactive editor.

<h1 id="title">Movie Review Page</h1>

You can reference the id name of title within your JavaScript or CSS. Here's a CSS example referencing the id of title to change the text color to red.

NOTE: Some CSS has been provided for you in this interactive example. Don't worry about trying to understand the CSS code because you will learn more about that in future lessons. But if you want to see the text color change to blue, enable the interactive editor, click on the styles.css tab and change the color: red; to color: blue;.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta
       name="viewport"
       content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Review page Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 id="title">Movie Review Page</h1>
  </body>
</html>
#title {
  color: red;
}
The hash symbol (#) in front of title, tells the computer you want to target an id with that value. id names should not be used more than once, and they should always be unique. Another thing to note about id values, is that they cannot have spaces in them. Here is an example of applying the words main and heading to an id attribute value:

<h1 id="main heading">Main heading</h1>
Browsers will see this space as part of the id which will lead to unwanted issues when it comes to styling and scripting. id attribute values should only contain letters, digits, underscores, and dashes.

In contrast to the id attribute, the class attribute value does not need to be unique and can contain spaces.

Here is an example of applying a class called box to a div element.

<div class="box"></div>
If you wanted to add multiple class names to an element, you can do so by separating the names by a space. Here is an updated example applying multiple classes to a div element.

<div class="box red-box"></div>
Here is an another example of applying multiple classes to multiple div elements.

NOTE: Some CSS has been provided for you in this interactive example. Don't worry about trying to understand the CSS code because you will learn more about that in future lessons. But if you wanted to change the color of the first and third boxes, enable the interactive editor and click on the styles.css tab and change the background-color: red; to background-color: black;.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta
       name="viewport"
       content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Colored boxes example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="box red-box"></div>
    <div class="box blue-box"></div>
    <div class="box red-box"></div>
    <div class="box blue-box"></div>
  </body>
</html>
.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}

.red-box {
  background-color: red;
}

.blue-box {
  background-color: blue;
}
So, to recap, when should you use an id versus a class? Classes are best used when you want to apply a set of styles to many elements. If you want to target a specific element, it is best to use id because those values need to be unique.

Questions

When should you use an id versus a class? Use an id when you need a unique identifier for a specific element, and use a class when you want to apply styles or behavior to multiple elements.

What happens if you use the same id more than once in your HTML? It can lead to unwanted results and issues when trying to apply styles or targeting an element in JavaScript.

Which of the following is NOT a correct value for the id attribute? id="main heading"

What Are HTML Entities, and What Are Some Common Examples? An HTML entity, or character reference, is a set of characters used to represent a reserved character in HTML.

Let's say you wanted to display the text This is an <img/> element on the screen. If you use the code currently in the editor, it won't display the desired result. Even if you added src and alt attributes to the example, it would show an image in the middle of the paragraph. Not the desired result. To interact with the example, you will need to enable the interactive editor.

<p>This is an <img /> element</p>
When the HTML parser sees the less than (<) symbol followed by an HTML tag name, it interprets that as an HTML element. That is why you are not getting the desired result of This is an <img/> element on the screen.

To fix this issue, you can use HTML entities. Here is an updated example using the correct HTML entities for the less (<) than and greater than (>) symbols. Now you should see This is an <img/> element on the screen.

Enable the interactive editor and try adding a &lt;p&gt;learning is fun&lt;/p&gt; below the paragraph element. You should see <p>learning is fun</p> on the screen.

<p>This is an &lt;img /&gt; element</p>

These types of character references are known as named character references. Named references start with an ampersand sign (&) and end with a semicolon (;). By using a named character reference, the HTML parser will not confuse this with an actual HTML element.

Another type of character reference would be the decimal numeric reference. This character reference starts with an ampersand sign and hash symbol (#), followed by one or more decimal digits, followed by a semicolon.

Here is an example of using the decimal numeric reference for the less than symbol.

Enable the interactive editor and change the code to see different symbols. You can use &#169; for the copyright symbol and &#174; for the trademark symbol.

&#60;
The last type of character reference would be the hexadecimal numeric reference. This character reference starts with an ampersand sign, hash symbol, and the letter x. Then it is followed by one or more ASCII hex digits and ends with a semicolon.

Here is an example of using the hexadecimal numeric reference for the less than symbol.

Enable the interactive editor and change the code to see different symbols. You can use &#x20AC; for the euro symbol and &#x03A9; for the Greek capital letter Omega symbol.

&#x3C;
Questions

What is an HTML entity (character reference)? A set of characters used to represent a reserved character in HTML.

What are the three types of character references? Named, Decimal numeric, and Hexadecimal numeric character references.

Which of the following is the correct syntax for a named character reference? &amp;

What Is the Role of the Script Element in HTML, and How Can It Be Used to Link to External JavaScript Files?
The script element is used to embed executable code. Most developers will use this to execute JavaScript code. JavaScript is used to add interactivity to your web pages. Common examples of using JavaScript include interactive games, image sliders, and dynamic forms that validate user input in real-time.

Here is an example of using the script element in an HTML document. Remove the // from in front of the alert("Welcome to freeCodeCamp"); and you should see an alert pop up. To see the previews, you will need to enable the interactive editor.

<body>
  <script>
    // alert("Welcome to freeCodeCamp");
  </script>
</body>
While you can technically write all of your JavaScript code inside the script tags, it is considered best practice to link to an external JavaScript file instead. Here is an example of using the script element to link to an external JavaScript file:

<script src="path-to-javascript-file.js"></script>
The src attribute is used here to specify the location for that external JavaScript file. src stands for "source". The reason why it is not encouraged to place all of your JavaScript inside the HTML document is because of separation of concerns. Separation of concerns is a design principle where you separate your programs into distinct sections and have each section address a separate concern. In this case, we want to separate our JavaScript code from our HTML code.

Questions

Which attribute is used to link to an external JavaScript file? The src attribute.

What is separation of concerns? A design principle where you separate your programs into distinct sections and have each section address a separate concern.

Understanding how the HTML affects SEO

What Is the Role of the Meta Description, and How Does It Affect SEO?
SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is a practice that optimizes web pages so they become more visible and rank higher on search engines. One way to improve your site's SEO, is to provide a short description for the web page using the meta element. Here is an example of using the meta element to set a page description for a gardening site:
<meta
  name="description"
  content="Discover expert tips and techniques for gardening in small spaces, choosing the right plants, and maintaining a thriving garden."
/>
By setting the name attribute to description, it ensures that browsers, search engines, and other web tools correctly interpret this metadata. The content attribute is where you will place your description. It is recommended that you keep your descriptions short and concise. This is because search engines will often truncate the description based on the results page layout.

Similar to other types of meta elements, the meta description will not be visible on the web page itself. One place where the page description can be found is in the search engine results page snippet. Here are some examples of page result snippets for freeCodeCamp's subreddit and GitHub repositories:
r\FreeCodeCamp: This is the official subreddit for the freeCodeCamp.org community. Learn to
code for free together with millions of other people...
Our full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum is completely free and self-
paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you...

In the examples, each of the page descriptions are located just beneath the site links. Within a couple of seconds, users can get a general sense of what the page is about and decide to click on the links for more information.

Even though meta descriptions won't directly affect a site's ranking on search engine, having a strong description could result in more traffic to your website.

Questions:
Which element is used to set the description for a web page? meta
What does SEO stand for? Search Engine Optimization
Where does the page's description typically show up? In the search engine results page.

What Is the Role of Open Graph Tags, and How Do They Affect SEO?

The open graph protocol enables you to control how your website's content appears across various social media platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and many more. By setting these open graph properties, you can entice users to want to click and engage with your content. You can set these properties through a collection of meta elements inside your HTML head section.

The first important OG property to include would be the title. Here is an example of setting the OG title for the freeCodeCamp homepage:
<meta content="freeCodeCamp.org" property="og:title" />

For the property attribute, you will need to specify that it is og:title. The content attribute is where you will write the title you want displayed for social media sites.

The next important OG property would be the type. Here is an example of using the OG type for the freeCodeCamp homepage:
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />

The type property is used to represent the type of content being shared on social media. Examples of this content include articles, websites, videos, or music.

The third important OG property would be the image. Here is an example of setting the OG image for the freeCodeCamp homepage:
<meta
  content="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png"
  property="og:image"
/>

In this example, the open graph image is pointing to the freeCodeCamp logo. All of these images should be high quality with good dimensions and ratios. Most social media platforms will include criteria for image requirements to help you ensure that your content displays well on their site. For example, the developers.facebook.com documentation page states:

"use images that are at least 1200 by 630 pixels for the best display on high resolution devices. At the minimum, you should use images that are 600 by 315 pixels to display link page posts with larger images."

The fourth important OG property would be the url. Here is an example of setting the OG url for the freeCodeCamp homepage:
<meta property="og:url" content="https://www.freecodecamp.org" />

There are many more OG properties that you can set, like description, audio, video and locale. However, the open graph url, image, type, and title are the most important ones to include.

So how do these open graph properties affect Search Engine Optimization? When your content is shared on social media, well-crafted OG properties can enhance the appearance for your content in users' feeds. This can lead to higher click-through rates which could signal to search engines that your content is relevant and engaging.

Questions:
What are open graph properties used for? To set how your website's content will be seen on different social media platforms.
What does the property="og:title" do in the meta element?  It specifies the title of your web page content when it is shared on social media platforms.
What does the property="og:type" do in the meta element?  It specifies the type of content used for your web page when it is shared on social media platforms.

Working with Audio and Video Elements (Theory)

What Are the Roles of the HTML Audio and Video Elements, and How Do They Work?

The audio and video elements allow you to add sound and video content to your HTML documents. The audio element supports popular audio formats like mp3, wav, and ogg. The video element supports mp4, ogg, and webm formats.

To include audio content on your web page, you can use the audio element with the src attribute pointing to the location of your audio file.

As you can see in the preview window, nothing shows up on the page. To see the previews, you will need to enable the interactive editor.

<audio src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/js-music-player/cruising-for-a-musing.mp3"></audio>
If you want to see the audio player on the page, then you can add the audio element with the controls attribute.

Press play in the preview window to hear one of Quincy Larson's songs. To hear a different song, change the src value to "https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/js-music-player/never-not-favored.mp3". To see the previews, you will need to enable the interactive editor.

<audio src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/js-music-player/cruising-for-a-musing.mp3" controls></audio>
The controls attribute enables users to manage audio playback, including adjusting volume, and pausing, or resuming playback. The controls attribute is a boolean attribute that can be added to an element to enable built-in playback controls. If omitted, no controls will be shown.

Apart from the src and controls attributes, there are several other attributes that enhance the functionality of the audio element. The loop attribute is a boolean attribute that makes the audio replay continuously.

Here's an example of using the loop attribute to play one of Quincy Larson's songs titled "Can't stay down". To see the looping in action, enable the interactive editor, scrub the play head close the end of the song and it will restart again once it is finished.

<audio
  src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/js-music-player/can't-stay-down.mp3"
  loop
  controls
></audio>
Another attribute you can use is the muted attribute. When present in the audio element, this boolean attribute will start the audio in a muted state. Here's an example of using the muted attribute.

To hear the music, enable the interactive editor and click on the volume icon in the audio player.

<audio
  src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/js-music-player/can't-stay-down.mp3"
  loop
  controls
  muted
></audio>
When it comes to audio file types, there are differences in which browsers support which type. To accommodate this, you can use source elements inside the audio element and the browser will select the first source that it understands. Here's an example of using multiple source elements for an audio element:

<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
  <source src="audio.wav" type="audio/wav" />
  <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
</audio>
The browser will first start with the ogg type, and if it can't play the audio, then it'll move down to the next type in the list.

All the attributes we have learned so far are also supported in the video element. Here's an example of using a video element with the loop, controls, and muted attributes.

Add the autoplay attribute to the opening video tag so the video plays automatically. To interact with the example, you will need to enable the interactive editor.

NOTE: The width attribute is being used here to make the video smaller and fit better in the preview window. You will learn more about the width attribute in future lessons.

<video
  src="https://archive.org/download/BigBuckBunny_124/Content/big_buck_bunny_720p_surround.mp4"
  loop
  controls
  muted
  width="400"
></video>
For the src, or source attribute, we are using a video called "Big Buck Bunny" from archive.org. If you wanted to display an image while the video is downloading, you can use the poster attribute. This attribute is not available for audio elements and is unique to the video element. Here's an example of using the poster attribute with content provided by peach.blender.org.

<video
  src="https://archive.org/download/BigBuckBunny_124/Content/big_buck_bunny_720p_surround.mp4"
  loop
  controls
  muted
  poster="https://peach.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/title_anouncement.jpg?x11217"
  width="400"
></video>

What attribute allows the audio to start in a muted state? muted
Which attribute lets you see the play and pause buttons? controls
What is the purpose of the poster attribute in the video element? To display an image while the video is downloading.

Working with Images and SVGs (Theory)

What Are Common Ways to Optimize Media Assets?
There are three tools to consider when using media, such as images, on your web pages: the size, the format, and the compression.

Let's talk about the size of your images first. When you are building a website, you'll often style images to display in a specific size. For example, you might have an image display at a 640x480 resolution. 640 represents the width while 480 represents the height in pixels. When preparing your image you want to scale it to a 640x480 size to match that styling. If you serve an image that is 1920x1080 but you are styling it to be much smaller, you're requiring your users to download unnecessary data. A smaller resolution results in a smaller file size.

The next thing to consider is your file format. Two of the most common file formats are PNG and JPG, but these are no longer the most ideal formats for serving images. Unless you need support for older browsers, you should consider using a more optimized format, like WEBP or AVIF.

Finally, you can run compression algorithms on your images. A compression algorithm is used to reduce the size for files or data. There are options like pngcrush to compress your images locally, or you can use online compression tools. However, it's worth noting that specific file formats, such as JPG, are not lossless. Lossless means that the original data can be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data. If you try to compress a JPG image, it will result in a degraded quality. You should keep all these things in mind when selecting images for your web pages.

How should you scale, or size, your images?  Your images should be the same scale as the rendered size on the page.
Which of the following is NOT a valid image file type? TS 
Which file format should you never compress? JPG

What Are the Different Types of Image Licenses, and How Do They Work?
Images are considered intellectual property, this means that they are protected by copyright regulations, most often belonging to the creator. By default, images are released as all rights reserved. The creator, or publisher sometimes, holds all copyright for the image.

This means that you cannot use them in your web page unless you do one of three things: obtain written permission from the copyright holder, purchase a license from the copyright holder, or incorporate the image in a way that falls under fair use.

That third point is a bit tricky. Fair use requires that your use of the image is both limited and transformative. Some examples of fair use would be to comment on or review the art or create a parody of the image.

Some images might be released under a permissive license, like a Creative Commons license, or the BSD license that freeCodeCamp uses. These images are available for use in your website, but you'll need to read the license to understand the rules you need to follow when using these images. For example, you might be required to make your website open source, or you may not be permitted to modify the image in any way.

Finally, some images may be released to the public domain. An image under the public domain has no copyright attached to it and is free to be used without any restrictions. Images licensed specifically under the Creative Commons 0 license are considered public domain.

Most search engines will allow you to filter image results by a license. There are also sites like Pixabay and Unsplash, which offer free-to-use images. Always be mindful of the copyright and licensing when you use an image in your website.

What is the default license for images? All rights reserved
Which license releases works to the public domain? Creative Commons 0
How can you find images that you are allowed to use?  Use websites like Pixabay or Unsplash.

What Are SVGs, and When Should You Use Them?
First, you need to understand how images work. Common image formats like PNG and JPG are classified as raster formats. This essentially means that they are pixel-based, with the data tracking the color value in each pixel.

A large downside of raster based images is that they do not upscale well. If you've ever tried to make a PNG larger, you may have seen that it becomes pixelated, or blurry.

An SVG is a different kind of image. SVG stands for a scalable vector graphic. A vector graphic tracks data based on paths and equations to plot points, lines, and curves. What this really means is that a vector graphic, like an SVG, can be scaled to any size without impacting the quality.

SVGs specifically have the added benefit of storing data in XML. This means you can use them directly in your code as raw HTML with the svg element. It also means you can programmatically change the color of the image.

To change the smiley face to red, enable the interactive editor and change the fill="yellow" to fill="red".

<svg width="100" height="100" viewBox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="45" stroke="black" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow" />
  <circle cx="35" cy="40" r="5" fill="black" />
  <circle cx="65" cy="40" r="5" fill="black" />
  <path d="M35 65 Q50 80 65 65" stroke="black" stroke-width="4" fill="transparent" />
</svg>
Here are the basic elements for the example:

The svg element is the container for the whole drawing. It sets up the space where all the shapes appear. Everything you want to draw with SVG, such as circles, lines, or paths, goes inside the svg element.
The circle element is used to make the face and the eyes. One large circle forms the yellow face, and two smaller circles make the eyes.
The path element is used to draw the smile. It creates a curved line for the mouth.
Each SVG element has attributes that control its appearance and position within the drawing area.
Here are a few more examples. To change the color for any of the examples, update the value for the fill attribute to any named color like red, green, blue, yellow, etc.

<!-- Star Icon -->
<svg width="50" height="50" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="gold" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path d="M12 2L14.9 8.6L22 9.3L17 14.1L18.3 21.2L12 17.8L5.7 21.2L7 14.1L2 9.3L9.1 8.6L12 2Z"/>
</svg>

<!-- Heart Icon -->
<svg width="50" height="50" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="crimson" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path d="M12 21.35L10.55 20.03C5.4 15.36 2 12.28 2 8.5C2 6 4 4 6.5 4C8 4 9.5 4.8 10.5 6.09C11.5 4.8 13 4 14.5 4C17 4 19 6 19 8.5C19 12.28 15.6 15.36 10.45 20.04L12 21.35Z"/>
</svg>

<!-- Checkmark Icon -->
<svg width="50" height="50" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="green" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path d="M20.29 5.71L9 17L3.71 11.71L5.12 10.29L9 14.17L18.88 4.29L20.29 5.71Z"/>
</svg>
So when would you want to use an SVG? A great use case is for icons. If you want to create custom bullet points, or add icons to your links to represent social media platforms, using SVGs is the best approach. One of the most popular icon libraries, Font Awesome, uses SVG images for their icons. SVGs are also great for webpage logos, because they scale perfectly. They allow you to adapt your layout to any responsive design you need. Next time you have an SVG locally, try opening it with a text editor and playing with the code.

What is a raster image? An image which stores color data for each pixel.
What is a vector image? An image which stores paths, lines, points, and curves.
How does an SVG store data? As XML.

Working with the iframe Element
What Are Replaced Elements, and What Are Some Examples?

A replaced element is an element whose content is determined by an external resource rather than by CSS itself. CSS, or cascading stylesheets, is used to add styles to a web page. Common examples of replaced elements include the image, iframe, and video elements.

With replaced elements, you can control the position, or layout of an element. But your CSS cannot directly modify the content of that element. This might be easier to explain with some examples. Consider the image element, which embeds an image on your web page:

<img src="example-img-url" alt="Descriptive text goes here">
The element itself is replaced with the external object: the image. Your CSS can control things like the positioning of the image, or apply a filter to it, but you cannot actually modify the image itself. A more robust example might be the iframe element, which embeds an external site on your web page.

Here is an example of using the iframe element for a popular YouTube video on the freeCodeCamp channel. If you want to see different videos in the preview window, change the value of the src attribute to a video of your choosing. To see the previews, you will need to enable the interactive editor.

NOTE: Don't worry about the extra attributes mentioned in the interactive example like referrerpolicy and allowfullscreen. You will learn more about working with iframe elements in a future workshop.

<iframe width="400" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u43gJJrVa1I?si=BoDW_puFsy8OEr_Z" title="Professional Cloud Architect Certification Course – Pass the Exam! (YouTube video)" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
Other common examples of using the iframe element would be to embed maps onto the page. Here is an example of an embedded map.

Enable the interactive editor and try playing around with the map itself by zooming in/out.

<iframe
  title="Map of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, London"
  width="300"
  height="200"
  src="https://www.openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html?bbox=-0.004017949104309083%2C51.47612752641776%2C0.00030577182769775396%2C51.478569861898606&amp;layer=mapnik">
</iframe>
The element itself is replaced with the external object: the site. Your CSS can change the positioning of the embedded site, but you cannot modify the site's contents. To dive a bit further, if the embedded site has an h1 element, your CSS would not be able to style that h1 element. You cannot change the size, font color, and so on.

There are some other replaced elements, such as video, and embed. And some elements behave as replaced elements under specific circumstances. Here's an example of an input element with the type attribute set to image:

<input type="image" alt="Descriptive text goes here" src="example-img-url">
This type of input is considered to be a replaced element, but other input types like text, or email are not replaced elements.

Questions:
What can you style in a replaced element? Everything.
What is a replaced element replaced with? An external object.
Which of these is a replaced element? iframe

How Do You Embed Videos onto Your Page Using the iframe Element?
In a prior lesson, you were first introduced to the iframe element. In this lesson, you will learn more about how to work with the iframe element. This element stands for inline frame. It's an inline element used to embed other HTML content directly within the HTML page. That HTML content could be a video, map, another HTML element, or even other web pages.

Here's an example of embedding a popular freeCodeCamp course from YouTube. To see a different video, enable the interactive editor and change the src value to a video of your choosing.

<iframe
  width="400"
  height="400"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PkZNo7MFNFg?si=-UBVIUNM3csdeiWF"
  title="Learn JavaScript - Full Course for Beginners (YouTube video)"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
The src attribute specifies the URL of the page you want to embed. The width attribute specifies the width of the iframe. The height attribute specifies the height of the iframe. The allowfullscreen attribute allows the user to display the iframe in full screen mode. It's also a good practice to specify a title attribute for the iframe, as it's important for accessibility.

The allow attribute, on the other hand, lets you define what an iframe can or can't do. This is called an allowlist. In the above example, adding clipboard-write to it allows the embedded page to write items to your clipboard. Items in an allowlist can be separated by semicolons or spaces, and both can be used together.

Note that the video can come from anywhere. It doesn't have to come from video services like YouTube and Vimeo.

Don't forget you can also embed a map, another web page, or direct HTML within the iframe element. Here is an example of an embedded map.

Try interacting with the map by zooming in and out.

<h1>A Map from Openstreetmap.org Embedded with the iframe Element</h1>

<iframe
  width="425"
  height="350"
  src="https://www.openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html?bbox=3.006134033203125%2C6.150112578753815%2C3.6357879638671875%2C6.749850810550778&amp;layer=mapnik"

<br />
<small>
  <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=11/6.4501/3.3210">
    View Larger Map
  </a>
</small>
If you want to embed direct HTML within the iframe element you have to use the srcdoc attribute instead of src.

Questions

What does iframe mean? Inline frame.
Which attribute of the iframe element specifies the location of what you want to embed? src
Which attribute of the iframe element do you use instead of src if you want to embed direct HTML? srcdoc

Working with links

What Are the Different Target Attribute Types, and How Do They Work?

You may have seen the target attribute on anchor elements, or links. This important attribute tells the browser where to open the URL for the anchor element.

Enable the interactive editor, click on the link and you will be directed to the freeCodeCamp homepage in a new browser tab.

<a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">Visit freeCodeCamp</a>
There are four important possible values for this attribute. Note that each value is preceded by an underscore.

The first value is _self, which is the default value. This opens the link in the current browsing context. In most cases, this will be the current tab or window.

The second value is _blank, which opens the link in a new browsing context. Typically, this will open in a new tab. But some users might configure their browsers to open a new window instead.

The third value is _parent, which opens the link in the parent of the current context. For example, if your website has an iframe, a _parent value in that iframe would open in your website's tab/window, not in the embedded frame.

The fourth value is _top, which opens the link in the top-most browsing context - think "the parent of the parent". This is similar to _parent, but the link will always open in the full browser tab/window, even for nested embedded frames.

There is a fifth value, called _unfencedTop, which is currently used for the experimental FencedFrame API. At the time of this lesson, you probably won't have a reason to use this one yet.

Selecting the right target value to control where your users end up is an important consideration when creating a website.

Questions:

How many current target values are there to choose from? 4
Where will a link with target="_blank" open? In a new window or tab.
What is the default behavior when you do not set a target? Opens in the same window or tab.

What Is the Difference Between Absolute and Relative Paths?

A path is a string that specifies the location of a file or directory in a file system. In web development, paths let developers link to resources like images, stylesheets, scripts, and other web pages. There are absolute and relative paths - both are essential when specifying file locations within a file system. Let's look at the two so you can decide which one of them to use and when.

An absolute path is a complete link to a resource. It starts from the root directory, includes every other directory, and finally the filename and extension. The "root directory" refers to the top-level directory or folder in a hierarchy.

An absolute path also includes the protocol - which could be http, https, and file and the domain name if the resource is on the web. Here's an example of an absolute path that links to the freeCodeCamp logo:

<a href="https://design-style-guide.freecodecamp.org/img/fcc_secondary_small.svg">
  View fCC Logo
</a>
In this example, the protocol is https, the domain name is design-style-guide.freecodecamp.org, and the filename is fcc_secondary_small.svg.

Now, what if the resource you want to link to using an absolute path is on your local machine? Here's how to link to the about.html file with an absolute path:

<p>
  Read more on the
  <a
    href="/Users/user/Desktop/fCC/script-code/absolute-vs-relative-paths/pages/about.html"
    >About Page</a
    >
</p>
It looks like this because we are going into a folder called Users, then into a folder called user, then into a folder called Desktop, then into a folder called fCC, then into a folder called script-code, then into a folder called absolute-vs-relative-paths, then into a folder called pages to finally get the about.html file.

Here's what the absolute URL looks like in the browser address bar:

file:///Users/user/Desktop/fCC/script-code/absolute-vs-relative-paths/pages/about.html
The URL includes the protocol, file://. It also includes the path, which looks like this: /Users/user/Desktop/fCC/script-code/absolute-vs-relative-paths/pages/, and represents the series of folders that lead to the file. And finally, it also includes the about.html, which is the filename and the extension.

Now, lets look at the relative path. A relative path specifies the location of a file relative to the directory of the current file. It does not include the protocol or the domain name, making it shorter and more flexible for internal links within the same website. Here's an example of linking to the about.html page from the contact.html page, both of which are in the same folder:

<p>
  Read more on the
  <a href="about.html">About Page</a>
</p>
So imagine you are on the contact.html page, and because the about.html page is in the same place, you simply get the filename. This is an example of using a relative file path.

So, which should you use and when; an absolute path or a relative path? Here are the rules you should follow:

Use absolute paths when linking to a resource hosted on an external website.

Use absolute paths when you need the link to a page or resource to work consistently regardless of the document location within the site.

Use relative paths when linking to resources within the same website.

Use relative paths if you want to keep your code cleaner and easier to maintain during development.

Use relative paths during local testing to ensure links work without an internet connection.

Questions:

What are the two types of paths? Absolute and relative paths.
How do you link to a resource available only on the internet? Absolute path.
Which protocol is used for an absolute path on a local machine? file://

What Is the Difference Between Slashes, a Single Dot, and Double Dot in Path Syntax?

You may have seen links like /public/logo.png, ./script.js, or ../styles.css before. But what do these special types of links mean? These are called file paths. There are three key syntaxes to know. First is the slash, which can be a backslash (\) or forward slash (/) depending on your operating system. The second is the single dot (.). And finally, we have the double dot (..).

The slash is known as the "path separator". It is used to indicate a break in the text between folder or file names. This is how your computer knows that naomis-files/ points to a directory of that same name, while naomis/files/ points to a files directory in the naomis directory.

A single dot points to the current directory, and two dots point to the parent directory. You will typically see a single dot used to ensure that the path is recognized as a relative path. Remember that you learned in a previous lesson about relative versus absolute paths before.

Double dots, however, are much more common to access files outside of the current working directory.

For example, given this file tree:

my-app/
├─ public/
│  ├─ favicon.ico
│  ├─ index.html
├─ src/
│  ├─ index.css
│  ├─ index.js
If your public/index.html file needed to load the favicon.ico file, you would use a relative path with a single dot to access the current directory: ./favicon.ico. If your public/index.html file needed to load the index.css file, you would use a relative path with double dots to navigate to the parent my-app directory first, then to the src directory, and finally to your file: ../src/index.css.

Questions:

Which option is an absolute path? /public/styles.css
Which option is a relative path to the current directory? ./script.js
Which option is a relative path to the parent directory? ../src/nav.html

What Are the Different Link States, and Why Are They Important?

You may have seen a link on a web page become purple after you click it. This is because the state of the link has changed, so different styling gets applied. There are five different states a link can be in.

The first is the default state, which is :link. This state represents a link which the user has not visited, clicked, or interacted with yet. You can think of this state as providing the base styles for all links on your page. The other states build on top of it.

Enable the interactive editor and take a look at the link in the preview window. It should be the default color of blue which represents the default state. If you click on it, then it will turn purple.

<a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">Visit freeCodeCamp</a>
The second state is :visited, which applies when a user has already visited the page being linked to. By default, this turns the link purple - but you can leverage CSS to provide a different visual indication to the user. This is helpful to let someone know they have already read a portion of your documentation. Or, that the site is one they can trust because they have used it before.

Click on the link in the preview window and you should see that the visited link changes to the color brown. To see the previews, you will need to enable the interactive editor.

NOTE: Some CSS has been provided for this interactive example so you can see the changes in the link styles. Don't worry about trying to understand the CSS code because you will learn what it all means in future modules.

<head>
    <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>

<body>
    <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">Visit freeCodeCamp</a>
</body>
a:visited {
  color: brown;
}
The third state is :hover. This state applies when a user is hovering their cursor over a link. This state is helpful for providing extra attention to a link, to ensure a user actually intends to click it.

Enable the interactive editor and try hovering your mouse over the link. You will see the color change to red.

<head>
    <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>

<body>
    <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">Visit freeCodeCamp</a>
</body>
a:hover {
  color: red;
}
Then we have :focus. This state applies when we focus on a link.

Click on any portion of the whitespace in the preview window and then press tab on your keyboard. You should see the link change to green. To see the previews, you will need to enable the interactive editor.

<head>
    <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>

<body>
    <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">Visit freeCodeCamp</a>
</body>
a:focus {
  color: green;
}
And finally, we have :active. This state applies to links that are being activated by the user. This typically means clicking on the link with the primary mouse button by left clicking, in most cases. This state can be helpful for showing a user that the element they clicked on is interactive.

Enable the interactive editor and click on the link. You should see the link turn to black. This happens pretty quickly so you might need to click on it a few times to see the color change.

<head>
    <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>

<body>
    <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">Visit freeCodeCamp</a>
</body>
a:active {
  color: black;
}
When you use these states to style your links, there is a specific order you need to write your CSS in: link, visited, hover, focus, then active.

You should now know how to give links in your page your own personal flair, while still providing the important information a user needs about the state of each link.

Questions:

What is the default state of a link? :link
Which state applies while a user is clicking the link? :active
In what order should you style your links? link, visited, hover, active.

Basic HTML Review:

HTML Basics
Role of HTML: HTML represents the content and structure of the web page.
HTML Elements: Elements are the building blocks for an HTML document. They represent headings, paragraphs, links, images and more. Most HTML elements consist of an opening tag (<elementName>) and a closing tag (</elementName>).
Here is the basic syntax:

<elementName>Content goes here</elementName>
Void Elements: Void elements cannot have any content and only have a start tag. Examples include img and meta elements.
<img>
<meta>
It is common to see some codebases that include a forward slash / inside the void element. Both of these are acceptable:

<img>
<img/>
Attributes: An attribute is a value placed inside the opening tag of an HTML element. Attributes provide additional information about the element or specify how the element should behave. Here is the basic syntax for an attribute:
<element attribute="value"></element>
A boolean attribute is an attribute that can either be present or absent in an HTML tag. If present, the value is true otherwise it is false. Examples of boolean attributes include disabled, readonly, and required.

Comments: Comments are used in programming to leave notes for yourself and other developers in your code. Here is the syntax for a comment in HTML:
<!--This is an HTML comment.-->
Common HTML elements
Heading Elements: There are six heading elements in HTML. The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements.
<h1>most important heading element</h1>
<h2>second most important heading element</h2>
<h3>third most important heading element</h3>
<h4>fourth most important heading element</h4>
<h5>fifth most important heading element</h5>
<h6>least important heading element</h6>
Paragraph Elements: This is used for paragraphs on a web page.
<p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
img Elements: The img element is used to add images to the web page. The src attribute is used to specify the location for that image. For image elements, it's good practice to include another attribute called the alt attribute. Here's an example of an img element with the src and alt attributes:
<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg" alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate.">
body Element: This element is used to represent the content for the HTML document.
<body>
  <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
</body>    
section Elements: This element is used to divide up content into smaller sections.
<section>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi, I am Jane Doe and I am a web developer.</p>
</section>
div Elements: This element is a generic HTML element that does not hold any semantic meaning. It is used as a generic container to hold other HTML elements.
<div>
  <h1>I am a heading</h1>
  <p>I am a paragraph</p>
</div>
Anchor (a) Elements: These elements are used to apply links to a web page. The href attribute is used to specify where the link should go when the user clicks on it.
<a href="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/running-cats.jpg">cute cats</a>
Unordered (ul) and Ordered (ol) List Elements: To create a bulleted list of items you should use the ul element with one or more li elements nested inside like this:
<ul>
  <li>catnip</li>
  <li>laser pointers</li>
  <li>lasagna</li>
</ul>
To create an ordered list of items you should use the ol element:

<ol>
  <li>flea treatment</li>
  <li>thunder</li>
  <li>other cats</li>
</ol>
Emphasis (em) Element: This is used to place emphasis on a piece of text.
<p>Cats <em>love</em> lasagna.</p>  
Strong Importance (strong) Element: This element is used to place strong emphasis on text to indicate a sense of urgency and seriousness.
<p>
  <strong>Important:</strong> Before proceeding, make sure to wear your safety goggles. 
</p>
figure and figcaption Elements: The figure element is used to group content like images and diagrams. The figcaption element is used to represent a caption for that content inside the figure element.
<figure>
  <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg" alt="Two tabby kittens sleeping together on a couch.">
  <figcaption>Cats <strong>hate</strong> other cats.</figcaption>  
</figure>
main Element: This element is used to represent the main content for a web page.
footer Element: This element is placed at the bottom of the HTML document and usually contains copyright information and other important page links.
<footer>
  <p>
    No Copyright - <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a>
  </p>
</footer>
Identifiers and Grouping
IDs: Unique element identifiers for HTML elements. ID names should only be used once per HTML document.
<h1 id="title">Movie Review Page</h1>
ID names cannot have spaces. If your ID name contains multiple words then you can use dashes between the words like this:

<div id="red-box"></div>
Classes: Classes are used to group elements for styling and behavior.
<div class="box"></div>
Unlike IDs, you can reuse the same class name throughout the HTML document. The class value can also have spaces like this:

<div class="box red-box"></div>
<div class="box blue-box"></div>
Special Characters and Linking
HTML entities: An HTML entity, or character reference, is a set of characters used to represent a reserved character in HTML. Examples include the ampersand (&amp;) symbol and the less than symbol (&lt;).
<p>This is an &lt;img /&gt; element</p>
link Element: This element is used to link to external resources like stylesheets and site icons. Here is the basic syntax for using the link element for an external CSS file:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
The rel attribute is used to specify the relationship between the linked resource and the HTML document. The href attribute is used to specify the location of the URL for the external resource.

script Element: This element is used to embed executable code.
<body>
  <script>
    alert("Welcome to freeCodeCamp");
  </script>
</body>
While you can technically write all of your JavaScript code inside the script tags, it is considered best practice to link to an external JavaScript file instead. Here is an example of using the script element to link to an external JavaScript file:

<script src="path-to-javascript-file.js"></script>
The src attribute is used here to specify the location for that external JavaScript file.

Boilerplate and Encoding
HTML boilerplate: This is a boilerplate that includes the basic structure and essential elements every HTML document needs.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>freeCodeCamp</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!--Headings, paragraphs, images, etc. go inside here-->
  </body>
</html>
DOCTYPE: This is used to tell browsers which version of HTML you're using.
html Element: This represents the top level element or the root of an HTML document. To specify the language for the document, you should use the lang attribute.
head Element: The head section contains important meta data which is behind-the-scenes information needed for browsers and search engines.
meta Elements: These elements represent your site's metadata. These element have details about things like character encoding, and how websites like Twitter should preview your page's link and more.
title Element: This element is used to set the text that appears in the browser tab or window.
UTF-8 character encoding: UTF-8, or UCS Transformation Format 8, is a standardized character encoding widely used on the web. Character encoding is the method computers use to store characters as data. The charset attribute is used inside of a meta element to set the character encoding to UTF-8.
SEO and Social Sharing
SEO: Search Engine Optimization is a practice that optimizes web pages so they become more visible and rank higher on search engines.
Meta (description) Element: This is used to provide a short description for the web page and impacting SEO.
<meta
  name="description"
  content="Discover expert tips and techniques for gardening in small spaces, choosing the right plants, and maintaining a thriving garden."
/>
Open Graph tags: The open graph protocol enables you to control how your website's content appears across various social media platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and many more.
By setting these open graph properties, you can entice users to want to click and engage with your content. You can set these properties through a collection of meta elements inside your HTML head section.

og:title Property: This is used to set the title that displays for social media posts.
<meta content="freeCodeCamp.org" property="og:title" />
og:type Property: The type property is used to represent the type of content being shared on social media. Examples of this content include articles, websites, videos, or music.
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
og:image Property: This is used to set the image shown for social media posts.
<meta
  content="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png"
  property="og:image"
/>
og:url Property: This is used to set the URL that users will click on for the social media posts.
<meta property="og:url" content="https://www.freecodecamp.org" />
Media Elements and Optimization
Replaced elements: A replaced element is an element whose content is determined by an external resource rather than by CSS itself. An example would be an iframe element. iframe stands for inline frame. It's an inline element used to embed other HTML content directly within the HTML page.
<iframe src="https://www.example.com" title="Example Site"></iframe>
You can include the allowfullscreen attribute which allows the user to display the iframe in full screen mode.

<iframe
  src="video-url"
  width="width-value"
  height="height-value"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
To embed a video within an iframe you can copy it directly from popular video services like YouTube and Vimeo, or define it yourself with the src attribute pointing to the URL of that video. Here's an example of embedding a popular freeCodeCamp course from YouTube:

<h1>A freeCodeCamp YouTube Video Embedded with the iframe Element</h1>

<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PkZNo7MFNFg?si=-UBVIUNM3csdeiWF"
  title="YouTube video player"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
There are some other replaced elements, such as video, and embed. And some elements behave as replaced elements under specific circumstances. Here's an example of an input element with the type attribute set to image:

<input type="image" alt="Descriptive text goes here" src="example-img-url">
Optimizing media: There are three tools to consider when using media, such as images, on your web pages: the size, the format, and the compression. A compression algorithm is used to reduce the size for files or data.
Image formats: Two of the most common file formats are PNG and JPG, but these are no longer the most ideal formats for serving images. Unless you need support for older browsers, you should consider using a more optimized format, like WEBP or AVIF.
Image licenses: An image under the public domain has no copyright attached to it and is free to be used without any restrictions. Images licensed specifically under the Creative Commons 0 license are considered public domain. Some images might be released under a permissive license, like a Creative Commons license, or the BSD license that freeCodeCamp uses.
SVGs: Scalable Vector Graphics track data based on paths and equations to plot points, lines, and curves. What this really means is that a vector graphic, like an SVG, can be scaled to any size without impacting the quality.
Multimedia Integration
audio and video Elements: The audio and video elements allow you to add sound and video content to your HTML documents. The audio element supports popular audio formats like mp3, wav, and ogg. The video element supports mp4, ogg, and webm formats.
<audio src="CrystalizeThatInnerChild.mp3"></audio>
If you want to see the audio player on the page, then you can add the audio element with the controls attribute:

<audio src="CrystalizeThatInnerChild.mp3" controls></audio>
The controls attribute enables users to manage audio playback, including adjusting volume, and pausing, or resuming playback. The controls attribute is a boolean attribute that can be added to an element to enable built-in playback controls. If omitted, no controls will be shown.

loop Attribute: The loop attribute is a boolean attribute that makes the audio replay continuously.
<audio
  src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/js-music-player/can't-stay-down.mp3"
  loop
  controls
></audio>
muted Attribute: When present in the audio element, the muted boolean attribute will start the audio in a muted state.
<audio
  src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/js-music-player/can't-stay-down.mp3"
  loop
  controls
  muted
></audio>
source Element: When it comes to audio file types, there are differences in which browsers support which type. To accommodate this, you can use source elements inside the audio element and the browser will select the first source that it understands. Here's an example of using multiple source elements for an audio element:
<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
  <source src="audio.wav" type="audio/wav" />
  <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
</audio>
All the attributes we have learned so far are also supported in the video element. Here's an example of using a video element with the loop, controls, and muted attributes:

<video
  src="https://archive.org/download/BigBuckBunny_124/Content/big_buck_bunny_720p_surround.mp4"
  loop
  controls
  muted
></video>
poster Attribute: If you wanted to display an image while the video is downloading, you can use the poster attribute. This attribute is not available for audio elements and is unique to the video element.
<video
  src="https://archive.org/download/BigBuckBunny_124/Content/big_buck_bunny_720p_surround.mp4"
  loop
  controls
  muted
  poster="https://peach.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/title_anouncement.jpg?x11217"
  width="620"
></video>
Target attribute types
target Attribute: This attribute tells the browser where to open the URL for the anchor element. There are four important possible values for this attribute: _self, _blank, _parent and _top. There is a fifth value, called _unfencedTop, which is currently used for the experimental FencedFrame API. You probably won't have a reason to use this one yet.
_self Value: This is the default value for the target attribute. This opens the link in the current browsing context. In most cases, this will be the current tab or window.
<a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_self">Visit freeCodeCamp</a>
_blank Value: This opens the link in a new browsing context. Typically, this will open in a new tab. But some users might configure their browsers to open a new window instead.
<a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">Visit freeCodeCamp</a>
_parent Value: This opens the link in the parent of the current context. For example, if your website has an iframe, a _parent value in that iframe would open in your website's tab/window, not in the embedded frame.
<a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_parent">Visit freeCodeCamp</a>
_top Value: This opens the link in the top-most browsing context - think "the parent of the parent". This is similar to _parent, but the link will always open in the full browser tab/window, even for nested embedded frames.
<a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_top">Visit freeCodeCamp</a>
Absolute vs. Relative Paths
Path definition: A path is a string that specifies the location of a file or directory in a file system. In web development, paths let developers link to resources like images, stylesheets, scripts, and other web pages.
Path Syntax: There are three key syntaxes to know. First is the slash, which can be a backslash (\) or forward slash (/) depending on your operating system. The second is the single dot (.). And finally, we have the double dot (..). The slash is known as the "path separator". It is used to indicate a break in the text between folder or file names. A single dot points to the current directory, and two dots point to the parent directory.
public/index.html
./favicon.ico
../src/index.css
Absolute Path: An absolute path is a complete link to a resource. It starts from the root directory, includes every other directory, and finally the filename and extension. The "root directory" refers to the top-level directory or folder in a hierarchy. An absolute path also includes the protocol - which could be http, https, and file and the domain name if the resource is on the web. Here's an example of an absolute path that links to the freeCodeCamp logo:
<a href="https://design-style-guide.freecodecamp.org/img/fcc_secondary_small.svg">
  View fCC Logo
</a>
Relative Path: A relative path specifies the location of a file relative to the directory of the current file. It does not include the protocol or the domain name, making it shorter and more flexible for internal links within the same website. Here's an example of linking to the about.html page from the contact.html page, both of which are in the same folder:
<p>

Link states
:link: This is the default state. This state represents a link which the user has not visited, clicked, or interacted with yet. You can think of this state as providing the base styles for all links on your page. The other states build on top of it.
:visited: This applies when a user has already visited the page being linked to. By default, this turns the link purple - but you can leverage CSS to provide a different visual indication to the user.
:hover: This state applies when a user is hovering their cursor over a link. This state is helpful for providing extra attention to a link, to ensure a user actually intends to click it.
:focus: This state applies when we focus on a link.
:active: This state applies to links that are being activated by the user. This typically means clicking on the link with the primary mouse button by left clicking, in most cases.
