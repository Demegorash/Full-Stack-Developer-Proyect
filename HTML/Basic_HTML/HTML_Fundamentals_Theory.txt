What are Div Elements and When Should You Use Them?

The div element is used as a container to group other elements.

Here is an example of a div element. Add another paragraph element inside of the div element and see the changes in the preview window. To see the previews, you will need to enable the interactive editor.

<div>
  <p>Example paragraph element.</p>

</div>
You will mainly use the div element when you want to group HTML elements that will share a set of CSS styles. You will learn more about CSS in future lessons and workshops.

Even though the div element is commonly used in real world codebases, you should be careful not to overuse it. There are times when another element would be more appropriate.

For example, if you wanted divide up your content into sections, then the section element would be more appropriate than a div element.

Add another section element below the first one. Then inside of the section element, a h2 and p elements. You can use whatever text you like and you will see the changes in the preview window. To interact with the example, you will need to enable the interactive editor.

<section>
  <h2>Mammals</h2>
  <p>Mammals are warm-blooded animals with fur or hair. Most give birth to live young.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lion</li>
    <li>Elephant</li>
    <li>Dolphin</li>
  </ul>
</section>
The section element has semantic meaning over the div element which is not semantic. Semantics are the meaning of words or phrases in a language. In HTML, which is a language, elements have their own semantic meaning too. So, this means if you use a section element, the browser will pick up its semantic meaning and understand to treat this as a section - on desktops, mobiles, you name it. 

What semantic meaning does a div element have? The div element has no semantic meaning.

When is it most appropriate to use a div element in your HTML? When grouping related content for styling purposes.

What Are IDs and Classes, and When Should You Use Them?

The id attribute adds a unique identifier to an HTML element.

Here is an example of an h1 element with an id of title.

Below the h1 element, add an h2 element with an id set to "subtitle". You can write whatever text you like for the h2 and you will see the changes in the preview window. To interact with the example, you will need to enable the interactive editor.

<h1 id="title">Movie Review Page</h1>

You can reference the id name of title within your JavaScript or CSS. Here's a CSS example referencing the id of title to change the text color to red.

NOTE: Some CSS has been provided for you in this interactive example. Don't worry about trying to understand the CSS code because you will learn more about that in future lessons. But if you want to see the text color change to blue, enable the interactive editor, click on the styles.css tab and change the color: red; to color: blue;.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta
       name="viewport"
       content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Review page Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 id="title">Movie Review Page</h1>
  </body>
</html>
#title {
  color: red;
}
The hash symbol (#) in front of title, tells the computer you want to target an id with that value. id names should not be used more than once, and they should always be unique. Another thing to note about id values, is that they cannot have spaces in them. Here is an example of applying the words main and heading to an id attribute value:

<h1 id="main heading">Main heading</h1>
Browsers will see this space as part of the id which will lead to unwanted issues when it comes to styling and scripting. id attribute values should only contain letters, digits, underscores, and dashes.

In contrast to the id attribute, the class attribute value does not need to be unique and can contain spaces.

Here is an example of applying a class called box to a div element.

<div class="box"></div>
If you wanted to add multiple class names to an element, you can do so by separating the names by a space. Here is an updated example applying multiple classes to a div element.

<div class="box red-box"></div>
Here is an another example of applying multiple classes to multiple div elements.

NOTE: Some CSS has been provided for you in this interactive example. Don't worry about trying to understand the CSS code because you will learn more about that in future lessons. But if you wanted to change the color of the first and third boxes, enable the interactive editor and click on the styles.css tab and change the background-color: red; to background-color: black;.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta
       name="viewport"
       content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Colored boxes example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="box red-box"></div>
    <div class="box blue-box"></div>
    <div class="box red-box"></div>
    <div class="box blue-box"></div>
  </body>
</html>
.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}

.red-box {
  background-color: red;
}

.blue-box {
  background-color: blue;
}
So, to recap, when should you use an id versus a class? Classes are best used when you want to apply a set of styles to many elements. If you want to target a specific element, it is best to use id because those values need to be unique.

Questions

When should you use an id versus a class? Use an id when you need a unique identifier for a specific element, and use a class when you want to apply styles or behavior to multiple elements.

What happens if you use the same id more than once in your HTML? It can lead to unwanted results and issues when trying to apply styles or targeting an element in JavaScript.

Which of the following is NOT a correct value for the id attribute? id="main heading"

What Are HTML Entities, and What Are Some Common Examples? An HTML entity, or character reference, is a set of characters used to represent a reserved character in HTML.

Let's say you wanted to display the text This is an <img/> element on the screen. If you use the code currently in the editor, it won't display the desired result. Even if you added src and alt attributes to the example, it would show an image in the middle of the paragraph. Not the desired result. To interact with the example, you will need to enable the interactive editor.

<p>This is an <img /> element</p>
When the HTML parser sees the less than (<) symbol followed by an HTML tag name, it interprets that as an HTML element. That is why you are not getting the desired result of This is an <img/> element on the screen.

To fix this issue, you can use HTML entities. Here is an updated example using the correct HTML entities for the less (<) than and greater than (>) symbols. Now you should see This is an <img/> element on the screen.

Enable the interactive editor and try adding a &lt;p&gt;learning is fun&lt;/p&gt; below the paragraph element. You should see <p>learning is fun</p> on the screen.

<p>This is an &lt;img /&gt; element</p>

These types of character references are known as named character references. Named references start with an ampersand sign (&) and end with a semicolon (;). By using a named character reference, the HTML parser will not confuse this with an actual HTML element.

Another type of character reference would be the decimal numeric reference. This character reference starts with an ampersand sign and hash symbol (#), followed by one or more decimal digits, followed by a semicolon.

Here is an example of using the decimal numeric reference for the less than symbol.

Enable the interactive editor and change the code to see different symbols. You can use &#169; for the copyright symbol and &#174; for the trademark symbol.

&#60;
The last type of character reference would be the hexadecimal numeric reference. This character reference starts with an ampersand sign, hash symbol, and the letter x. Then it is followed by one or more ASCII hex digits and ends with a semicolon.

Here is an example of using the hexadecimal numeric reference for the less than symbol.

Enable the interactive editor and change the code to see different symbols. You can use &#x20AC; for the euro symbol and &#x03A9; for the Greek capital letter Omega symbol.

&#x3C;
Questions

What is an HTML entity (character reference)? A set of characters used to represent a reserved character in HTML.

What are the three types of character references? Named, Decimal numeric, and Hexadecimal numeric character references.

Which of the following is the correct syntax for a named character reference? &amp;

What Is the Role of the Script Element in HTML, and How Can It Be Used to Link to External JavaScript Files?
The script element is used to embed executable code. Most developers will use this to execute JavaScript code. JavaScript is used to add interactivity to your web pages. Common examples of using JavaScript include interactive games, image sliders, and dynamic forms that validate user input in real-time.

Here is an example of using the script element in an HTML document. Remove the // from in front of the alert("Welcome to freeCodeCamp"); and you should see an alert pop up. To see the previews, you will need to enable the interactive editor.

<body>
  <script>
    // alert("Welcome to freeCodeCamp");
  </script>
</body>
While you can technically write all of your JavaScript code inside the script tags, it is considered best practice to link to an external JavaScript file instead. Here is an example of using the script element to link to an external JavaScript file:

<script src="path-to-javascript-file.js"></script>
The src attribute is used here to specify the location for that external JavaScript file. src stands for "source". The reason why it is not encouraged to place all of your JavaScript inside the HTML document is because of separation of concerns. Separation of concerns is a design principle where you separate your programs into distinct sections and have each section address a separate concern. In this case, we want to separate our JavaScript code from our HTML code.

Questions

Which attribute is used to link to an external JavaScript file? The src attribute.

What is separation of concerns? A design principle where you separate your programs into distinct sections and have each section address a separate concern.

Which of the following is the correct syntax for linking to an external JavaScript file? <script src="path-to-javascript-file.js"></script>

Understanding how the HTML affects SEO

What Is the Role of the Meta Description, and How Does It Affect SEO?
SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is a practice that optimizes web pages so they become more visible and rank higher on search engines. One way to improve your site's SEO, is to provide a short description for the web page using the meta element. Here is an example of using the meta element to set a page description for a gardening site:
<meta
  name="description"
  content="Discover expert tips and techniques for gardening in small spaces, choosing the right plants, and maintaining a thriving garden."
/>
By setting the name attribute to description, it ensures that browsers, search engines, and other web tools correctly interpret this metadata. The content attribute is where you will place your description. It is recommended that you keep your descriptions short and concise. This is because search engines will often truncate the description based on the results page layout.

Similar to other types of meta elements, the meta description will not be visible on the web page itself. One place where the page description can be found is in the search engine results page snippet. Here are some examples of page result snippets for freeCodeCamp's subreddit and GitHub repositories:
r\FreeCodeCamp: This is the official subreddit for the freeCodeCamp.org community. Learn to
code for free together with millions of other people...
Our full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum is completely free and self-
paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you...

In the examples, each of the page descriptions are located just beneath the site links. Within a couple of seconds, users can get a general sense of what the page is about and decide to click on the links for more information.

Even though meta descriptions won't directly affect a site's ranking on search engine, having a strong description could result in more traffic to your website.

Questions:
Which element is used to set the description for a web page? meta
What does SEO stand for? Search Engine Optimization
Where does the page's description typically show up? In the search engine results page.

What Is the Role of Open Graph Tags, and How Do They Affect SEO?

The open graph protocol enables you to control how your website's content appears across various social media platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and many more. By setting these open graph properties, you can entice users to want to click and engage with your content. You can set these properties through a collection of meta elements inside your HTML head section.

The first important OG property to include would be the title. Here is an example of setting the OG title for the freeCodeCamp homepage:
<meta content="freeCodeCamp.org" property="og:title" />

For the property attribute, you will need to specify that it is og:title. The content attribute is where you will write the title you want displayed for social media sites.

The next important OG property would be the type. Here is an example of using the OG type for the freeCodeCamp homepage:
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />

The type property is used to represent the type of content being shared on social media. Examples of this content include articles, websites, videos, or music.

The third important OG property would be the image. Here is an example of setting the OG image for the freeCodeCamp homepage:
<meta
  content="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png"
  property="og:image"
/>

In this example, the open graph image is pointing to the freeCodeCamp logo. All of these images should be high quality with good dimensions and ratios. Most social media platforms will include criteria for image requirements to help you ensure that your content displays well on their site. For example, the developers.facebook.com documentation page states:

"use images that are at least 1200 by 630 pixels for the best display on high resolution devices. At the minimum, you should use images that are 600 by 315 pixels to display link page posts with larger images."

The fourth important OG property would be the url. Here is an example of setting the OG url for the freeCodeCamp homepage:
<meta property="og:url" content="https://www.freecodecamp.org" />

There are many more OG properties that you can set, like description, audio, video and locale. However, the open graph url, image, type, and title are the most important ones to include.

So how do these open graph properties affect Search Engine Optimization? When your content is shared on social media, well-crafted OG properties can enhance the appearance for your content in users' feeds. This can lead to higher click-through rates which could signal to search engines that your content is relevant and engaging.

Questions:
What are open graph properties used for? To set how your website's content will be seen on different social media platforms.
What does the property="og:title" do in the meta element?  It specifies the title of your web page content when it is shared on social media platforms.
What does the property="og:type" do in the meta element?  It specifies the type of content used for your web page when it is shared on social media platforms.
