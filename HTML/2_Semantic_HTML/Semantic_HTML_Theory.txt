Importance of Semantic HTML

Why Should You Care About Semantic HTML?

Semantics are the meaning of words, or phrases, in a language. In HTML, which is a language, elements have their own semantic meaning too. In fact, you can think of your HTML document like you would a text document. And much like a text document, you might have headings, images, bold text, and other formatting.

The semantic meaning of an element refers to what special information that element conveys. The semantic meaning of a p element, for example, is a paragraph of text:

<p>
  Let me tell you about my fantastic holiday in Paris.
  I saw the impressive Eiffel Tower up close!
</p>
Most elements have semantic meaning. The div element is one of the very few that does not. But why is this important?

First and foremost, using proper semantic HTML will ensure the best experience for users with assistive technology like screen readers. But also, semantic HTML can improve your search rankings. This is referred to as search engine optimization, or SEO.

Finally, using correct semantic elements can improve your development experience. Rather than having to sift through a bunch of developments to find your navigation bar, you can edit the nav element directly and know what you're changing. Throughout this section, you will learn more about these topics, how to use semantic elements, and why semantic HTML is so important.

Questions:

What does semantic refer to? The meaning and structure of words/phrases in a language.
Which element does not have semantic meaning? div
Why should you care about semantic HTML? All of the above It improves SEO. It improves accessibility. It improves developer experience.

Why is it Important to Have Good Structural Hierarchy?

The most important aspect of creating a structural hierarchy is the proper use of heading elements. Heading elements are numbered as h1, h2, h3, and so on. These numbers represent the heading level for that element.

Much like a text document, you do not want to use heading levels in the incorrect order. Your h1 element is your top-level heading. You will rarely have more than one of these on a page, and it should typically come before all of your content.

Your h2 element is your subheading. It should always come after your h1 and might come after some introductory text. Unlike an h1 element, you can have multiple h2 elements on your page. You'll often do this to delineate different sections of content.

Following the pattern, your h3 element should always come after an h2 element. That is, you should never skip directly from h1 to h3. You can, however, have multiple heading elements at the same level. For example, this code is correct:
<section>
  <h1>freeCodeCamp</h1>
  <h2>Learn Front-End Development</h2>
  <h2>Learn Back-End Development</h2>
</section>

But this code would not be correct, because h3 comes before h2.

Move the h2 element above the h3 so it is semantically correct. To interact with the code, you will need to enable the interactive editor.

<section>
  <h1>freeCodeCamp</h1>
  <h3>Introduction to HTML</h3>
  <h2>Learn Frontend Development</h2>
</section>
It may be tempting to use a specific heading element because of its styling, such as h1 for large text:

<article>
  <p>
    Here is some
    <h1>Large Text</h1>
  </p>
</article>
Instead, you should choose the appropriate element for your document structure and use CSS to achieve the styling you'd like.

Using the right hierarchy is important for accessibility. Assistive technologies, like screen readers, rely on the structure of a web page to determine how to parse and announce that web page to the user. Using an h3 element after an h1 might cause a screen reader user to believe they have accidentally skipped over important content, due to the lack of an h2 element.

Proper structure is also important for SEO. Search engines use automation to parse the content of your web page and determine when and where it should show up in results. If your structure is malformed, search engines may not be able to rank you very well in the relevant search results.

Finally, depending on how incorrect your structure is, your HTML may not even be technically valid. When this happens, the web browser has to effectively guess what you meant to do. And what it guesses might not even be what you want at all.

As you have learned today, there are many reasons to use the proper structural hierarchy for your page. Keep this in mind as you build new projects.

Questions:
Why is structural hierarchy important? Accessibility SEO So browsers know what we mean
Which heading element must precede an h3 element? h2
How should you create larger text on your page? Use the correct structural element, and style it with CSS.

What Is the Difference Between Presentational and Semantic HTML?
Presentational HTML focuses on the appearance and style of the content. In the early days of HTML, developers would use elements like the center, big, and font elements. But in modern web development you shouldn't use these types of elements, because of their limitations and negative impact on accessibility and maintainability.

Many presentational HTML elements are deprecated, which means that they are outdated and no longer recommended. There are better ways to get the same results. However, it is helpful to know that they exist, so we'll take a look at some examples.

The font element is a deprecated element used to set the font size and color of the text. Here's an example of a font element.

Enable the interactive editor and change the size from 5 to 7 to see the font increase.

<font size="5" color="blue">This text is blue and large.</font>
This example sets the color of the text to blue and the size to a value of 5. The range for the size attribute is from 1 to 7, with 1 being the smallest and 7 being the largest. The default value is 3, if you don't set the value explicitly.

While this element still works, you should not use it because the font size and color should always be set in CSS, not in HTML.

The center element is another deprecated element that is used to center the content horizontally within its container. Here's an example of the center element that contains text and a paragraph element.

Enable the interactive editor and add center tags around the <p>Another example text.</p> to see it centered on the page.

<center>
  This text is centered.
  <p>HTML is awesome.</p>
</center>

<p>Another example text.</p>
And next, we have the big element. This is another deprecated presentational HTML element that makes the enclosed text one level bigger than its surrounding text. Here we have an example that defines a paragraph with two parts.

Enable the interactive editor and add big tags around the Some other text and see the changes in the preview window.

<p>
  This text has a normal font size.
  <big>This text is larger.</big>
  Some other text.
</p>
Remember that font size should always be set with CSS, so you should not use this element in modern HTML.

These were examples of presentational HTML elements. But all of them are deprecated and no longer recommended. So what should you use instead? Let's see.

Semantic HTML is now the recommended practice. It describes the content of the elements, so it's much easier to read, understand, and maintain.

Search engines can easily understand your website when you use semantic HTML. It's also helpful for accessibility purposes, because screen readers need semantic information to describe what's on the web page.

Examples of semantic HTML elements include:

The header element for defining the header of the document, or section.
The navigation section element, nav, for sections with navigation links.
The section element for grouping related information.
The figure element for illustrations and diagrams.
This is an example of a header element that contains a navigation section element.

Enable the interactive editor and add a <a href="#">Products</a> inside of the nav and see the changes in the preview window.

<header>
  <nav>
    <a href="#">Home</a>
    <a href="#">About</a>
    <!--Add the products link here-->

    <a href="#">Contact</a>
  </nav>
</header>
The semantic elements clearly show their purpose within the HTML structure. There are many different semantic HTML elements. You will definitely find one that fits the needs of your project.

Great work. Now you know the difference between presentational and semantic HTML: semantic HTML describes the content, while presentational HTML focuses on the appearance.

Questions:

Which of the following best describes the difference between presentational and semantic HTML? Semantic HTML focuses on content structure, while presentational HTML focuses on appearance.
Which of the following is an example of presentational HTML? Using the center element to center the content.
Which of the following is an example of semantic HTML? Using the nav element to represent a navigation section

Understanding Nuanced Semantic Elements

When Should You Use the Emphasis Element Over the Idiomatic Text Element?

These elements are very closely related to the concepts of presentational and semantic HTML. The idiomatic text element, i, was originally used for presentational purposes to display the text in italics. But now, it is frequently used for highlighting alternative voice or mood, idiomatic terms from another language, technical terms, and thoughts.

Here is an example from the official HTML spec, using the i element to show an idiomatic phrase in French.

<p>There is a certain <i lang="fr">je ne sais quoi</i> in the air.</p>
The lang attribute inside the open <i> tag is used to specify the language of the content. In this case, the language would be French. The i element does not indicate if the text is important or not, it only shows that it's somehow different from the surrounding text.

If you do need to emphasize the importance of the text, you can use a similar semantic element called the emphasis element, em. This is usually recommended if you need to provide more context. You should use this element for parts of the text that require a special emphasis compared to surrounding text. It's usually limited to only a few words, because it can alter the meaning of the sentence.

This is an example of the emphasis element within a paragraph.

<p>
  Never give up on <em>your</em> dreams.
</p>
You can see the sentence Never give up on your dreams. Notice that the word your will be emphasized, because it's inside this element. In the browser you would see the word your is italicized to tell readers that this is an important word in the sentence.

Even if it looks the same when the text was inside the idiomatic text element, the semantic emphasis element conveys its meaning and importance behind the scenes.

It's important to know that these elements should not be used for presentational purposes only. If you need to display the text in italics, but the text doesn't have a special purpose, style, or meaning in the paragraph, you should use CSS instead.

Questions:

Which HTML element is used to differentiate text from its surrounding content without conveying specific importance? i
When should you use CSS instead of the i or em elements? When you want to display text in italics for presentational purposes only.
What is the primary difference between i and em? i indicates that the text differs from the surrounding content, while em emphasizes important text.

**************************************************************************************************************

When Should You Use the Strong Element Over the Bring Attention To Element?

The "bring attention to" element, b, is commonly used to highlight keywords in summaries, or product names in reviews. Usually, browsers display this text in boldface. Here's an example using the b element to highlight product names in this review:

<p>
  We tested several products, including the <b>SuperSound 3000</b> for audio
  quality, the <b>QuickCharge Pro</b> for fast charging, and the
  <b>EcoClean Vacuum</b> for cleaning. The first two performed well, but the
  <b>EcoClean Vacuum</b> did not meet expectations.
</p>
The browser renders these parts of the text as bold text. This visual emphasis will draw readers attention to the product names.

If you need to emphasize the importance of the text, you should use the strong element instead of the b element.

strong is a semantic HTML element that emphasizes text that is crucial, or urgent. This is an example where the strong element is used to label a very important warning about the potential allergic reactions that customers may have to a product:

<p>
  <strong>Warning:</strong> This product may cause allergic reactions.
</p>
The strong element communicates that sense of urgency.

Visually both are very similar, because they are both rendered as bold by default. But their meanings are quite different. While the "bring attention to" element only draws attention to the text, without indicating the higher level of importance, the strong element does more than that. It conveys a sense of importance, or urgency. This is their main difference.

To choose between them, consider the purpose of the text and its importance within the surrounding content.

Questions:
Which HTML element is used to draw attention to a specific part of the text without conveying specific importance? b
Which HTML element is used to indicate text that is specially important or urgent? strong
What is the primary difference between b and strong? b is for visual emphasis, while strong is for emphasizing importance.

What Are Description Lists, and When Should You Use Them?

Description lists are perfect for presenting terms and definitions in an organized and easy-to-read format, like in a glossary, or real dictionary, where you can find words with their corresponding definitions.

This is an example of a description list in HTML with two terms and their corresponding details.

Enable the interactive editor and try uncommenting the code to see the new detail item show up in the preview window.

<dl>
  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dd>HyperText Markup Language</dd>
  <dt>CSS</dt>
  <dd>Cascading Style Sheets</dd>
  <!-- <dt>JS</dt>
  <dd>JavaScript</dd> -->
</dl>
In this case the terms are the acronyms HTML and CSS, and the details are their expansions. The details could also be definitions, or other information related to the terms.

You will need three HTML elements to define a description list. First, the description list element, dl, which is the container for the entire list. You can see it wraps around all the other elements of the description list in the example.

Then, one description term element, dt, for each term. In this case the description list has two terms, HTML and CSS, so it has two of these elements.

And finally, after each term you will find a description details element, dd, for the description, or details associated with that term. In this example, they are Hypertext Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheets.

In the browser, you would see each term followed by its corresponding description. By default, the descriptions are slightly more indented towards the right to distinguish them visually.

But description lists are not limited to only terms and definitions. They are much more versatile than that. Here we have a recipe with two ingredients.

Enable the interactive editor and try uncommenting the code to see the new detail item show up in the preview window.

<dl>
  <dt>Flour</dt>
  <dd>2 cups</dd>
  <dt>Sugar</dt>
  <dd>1/2 cup</dd>
  <!-- <dt>Vegetable Oil</dt>
  <dd>2 tablespoons</dd> -->
</dl>
The entire description list is within a description list element. The first ingredient, Flour, is within a description term element. Then, you can see how much of this ingredient you will need: 2 cups. This is within a description details element directly after its corresponding ingredients.

And the same structure is repeated for Sugar. In this case, the recipe has only two ingredients, but if there were more the same structure could be repeated throughout the description list.

In the browser, you would see the ingredients aligned to the left, and the measurements indented to separate them visually.

Other use cases for description lists include product specifications, frequently asked questions, contact information, and metadata. Essentially, when you have two related pieces of information in a key-value pair format, where one acts as a label, the key, and the other acts as additional related information, the value, you can use a description list.

Questions:

Which HTML tag is used to define an entire description list? dl
Which HTML tag is used to represent a term in a description list? dt
Which HTML tag is used to define or provide more details about a term in a description list? dd
