Step 1
Camperbot has created a coding journey blog page, but it looks like the page has some accessibility issues and bad practices. Your job in this workshop, is to fix these issues for Camperbot.

The first set of errors has to deal with the use of headings. In a prior lesson, you learned that it is best practice to only use one h1 per page. But it looks like Camperbot is a using a few h1s.

Leave the <h1>Welcome to Camperbot's Blog</h1> alone and change the other h1 elements to h2 elements.

Step 2
It looks like there are still some issues with the use of headings on the page. If you look at the first div element, there are two h4 elements used as subheadings. A better practice would be to use h3 elements for these subheadings since they are a level below the h2 element.

Change the two h4 elements to h3 elements.

Step 3
In the second post section, there is an h5 element being used. It would be more appropriate to use an h3 element here.

Change the h5 element to an h3 element.

Step 4
Below the main title of the page, there is a navigation section that contains links to each blog post.

This section should be wrapped in a nav element to indicate its purpose as a navigation landmark.

Step 5
In the blog page, there are a total of three blog posts wrapped inside generic div elements. But it would be better to use semantic elements to wrap each post.

Change each div element that wraps each blog post to an article element.

Step 6
Since the entire section containing the blog posts represents the main content of the page, it should be wrapped in a main element. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the structure of the page better.

Step 7
For the last part of the workshop, there are a few changes needed for the contact section at the bottom.

The first change would be to wrap the contact section inside of a footer element. This will help screen readers identify this section as the footer of the page.

Step 8
Right now the footer section has an h3 heading. But it should be an h2 heading to maintain a proper heading hierarchy.

Change the h3 to an h2.

Step 9
The last change will be to the email text inside of the footer. In earlier lessons and workshops, you learned how to work with the mailto link like this:

Example Code:
<p>Email me at <a href="mailto:janedoe@email.com">janedoe@email.com</a></p>
Start by wrapping the camperbot@blog.io email address inside of an anchor element. Then, add the href attribute to the anchor element and set it equal to mailto:camperbot@blog.io.

With that last change, you have successfully resolved all of the issues in the blog page!
