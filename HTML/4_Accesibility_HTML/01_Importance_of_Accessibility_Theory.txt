What Is Accessibility?

Accessibility involves creating products and services that everyone can use. In the context of web development, it's making websites that everyone can understand and interact with, including people with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities.

Some examples of disabilities that can impact users' online experience include:

Blindness.
Low vision.
Color blindness.
Deafness.
Difficulty using keyboards, mice, or touchscreens.
Attention disorders
Memory issues.
Difficulty speaking or understanding spoken language.
Sensitivity to flashing lights.
These are just a few of many conditions that can impact users around the world.

To help you create accessible websites, the World Wide Web Consortium, known as W3C, developed a set of international standards that you can follow to make your websites more accessible and easier to use for people with disabilities.

These standards are known as the "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines" (WCAG).

These guidelines are designed with four core principles in mind, known as POUR.

P stands for Perceivable. Users must be able to perceive the information that you are presenting. For example, you can provide alternative text for images, so users who access your website with a screen reader can understand them.
O stands for Operable. Users must be able to interact with the user interface. For example, you can make sure that all functionality is accessible through the keyboard too, not just the mouse.
U stands for Understandable. Users must be able to understand the information. For example, you can avoid complex sentences and use simple language as much as possible.
R stands for Robust. A wide range of browsers and other tools, including assistive technologies, must be able to interpret the content.
Using semantic HTML is very helpful for making your website compatible with different browsers and assistive technologies.

If your content doesn't follow any one of these core principles, not everyone will be able to use your website.

To check if you are following these guidelines correctly, you can access the Quick Reference of the World Wide Web Consortium. There, you will find a comprehensive list of criteria and techniques.

Accessibility is essential for web development. By developing with inclusivity in mind, you can ensure that everyone can access and engage with your content, promote equality and create a better user experience for everyone around the world.

Questions

What is the primary goal of web accessibility? To ensure websites are usable by everyone.
What are the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)? A set of guidelines for making websites accessible to everyone.
Which of the following is NOT a core principle of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)? Compatible.

What Are Screen Readers, and Who Uses Them?

Screen readers are assistive technology programs that help blind and visually impaired people use computers and mobile devices.

Screen readers are not just tools for the blind and visually impaired to access computers and mobile devices.

They empower these individuals to access education, work opportunities, and social media. This ensures digital inclusion and enhances their ability to participate fully in society.

There's a common misconception that screen readers are text-to-speech devices.

However, text-to-speech is just one of the features of a screen reader. Some screen readers even render the text to braille output instead of speech.

Apart from text-to-speech and braille output, other notable features of screen readers are navigation aids and web browsing assistance.

Screen reader programs are also not only made for the blind and visually impaired. Dyslexic individuals and people with cognitive disabilities also use screen readers. All the popular operating systems out there have screen readers built into them.

macOS and iOS both have VoiceOver built-in. You can turn it on on your computer by pressing CMD + F5. You can access it on iPhones through Settings.

Windows computers have Narrator built-in. You can turn it on by pressing WIN + CTRL + ENTER. NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA) and Job Access With Speech (JAWS) are also available for Windows computers. NVDA is free and open-source, while JAWS is paid.

Linux has Orca for the desktop environment and Speakup for the Linux terminal.

Android phones have TalkBack built-in. You can turn it on by accessing Settings > Special Function > Accessibility > Talkback.

Some Android devices also have Ella and Select to Speak built in.

One major challenge for screen reader users is that many software developers don't design their products with screen-reader friendliness and accessibility in mind.

Even though accessibility is a broad topic, every developer needs to learn how to make their web software accessible for the blind and visually impaired, as well as other groups of people with disabilities.

This demonstrates empathy and a commitment to inclusivity, ensuring that all users can benefit from their work.

Questions

Which of the following is the screen reader built into macOS and iOS devices? VoiceOver
Which of the following are screen readers not made for? The deaf
Which of these is not a feature of screen readers?  Speech-to-text

**************************************************************************************************************************

What Are Large Text or Braille Keyboards, and Who Uses Them?

Large text and braille keyboards are designed for users with visual disabilities. In Large Text Keyboards, also called Large Print Keyboards, the letters, numbers, and symbols are larger compared to standard keyboards. This design is helpful for people who may find smaller text in the keys difficult to see. Most of them also have enhanced contrast and brightness.

A large print keyboard made by the brand MaxiAids has yellow keys with black, big, and bold letters, numbers, and symbols on them. This is helpful for people with low vision.

Another keyboard is the black large print keyboard with white print on the keys. This keyboard is also backlit, so users can adjust its brightness to different lighting conditions.

While large print keyboards provide visual cues for users with low vision, braille keyboards provide a completely tactile experience for people with more severe vision disabilities, including people who are blind.

Braille is a tactile reading and writing system. It consists of raised dots arranged in specific patterns to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation.

Braille keyboards use this system to help users find the right keys on the keyboard by feeling these patterns with their fingers. The keys have raised dots in patterns that represent letters, numbers and symbols.

And some keyboards combine both approaches- large fonts and braille patterns in the keys. This is helpful for people with visual disabilities and for people who are learning braille.

Large text and braille keyboards are tools that empower people with visual disabilities. By providing alternative input methods, these assistive technologies ensure that everyone can be part of the digital world.

Questions

What is one benefit of using large text keyboards? Improved readability of the keys.
Who primarily benefits from the use of large text and braille keyboards? People with visual disabilities.
How do people identify letters, numbers, and symbols in braille keyboards? By feeling patterns of raised dots with their fingers.

What Are Alternative Pointing Devices Such as Trackballs, Joysticks, and Touchpads Used For?

Alternative pointing devices are input devices that make good alternatives to the traditional mouse. They are essential for improving computer accessibility for those with disabilities, forelimb impairments, and limited mobility.

Common examples of alternative pointing devices are trackballs, joysticks, and touchpads.

A trackball is a stationary pointing device that consists of a large, movable ball within a socket. It also includes additional buttons for clicking and performing other functions.

Unlike the traditional mouse, which requires movement around a surface to control the cursor, a trackball remains in place. Users manipulate the ball directly with their fingers, thumb, or palm to move the cursor on the screen.

Some traditional mice also have a trackball on the top or side. These mice could make a good starting point if you want to gradually switch to a trackball.

Trackballs reduce the physical movement the user needs for navigation, making them ideal for users with mobility issues. Apart from that, if you need high precision and have limited desk space, a trackball is more ideal than a traditional mouse.

A joystick is a pointing device primarily designed for games and certain industrial applications like machinery control. It consists of a lever that pivots up, down, left, and right, and often includes additional buttons for various actions

Joysticks provide precise control over movement and actions within digital environments. This makes them popular for flight simulators, cranes, driving games, and other applications requiring precise directional input.

Because joysticks accommodate larger and more deliberate movements, they are beneficial for individuals with tremors and unsteady hands.

They also reduce the strain and pain that comes with repetitive movements, making them ideal for individuals with arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome.

A touchpad is a flat, touch-sensitive device built into laptops and some keyboards. It allows users to control the cursor on the screen by sliding their fingers across its surface.

Apart from the surface for cursor control, touchpads also feature buttons that emulate the actions of a traditional mouse, such as right-click and left-click.

Most people see touchpads as a better alternative to a mouse because they significantly enhance navigation by supporting multi-touch gestures like pinch-to-zoom, two-finger scrolling, tap-to-click, and three-finger swipes.

Touchpad is ideal for individuals with low arm or hand movement because the forelimb is almost always stationary while using it. It is also suitable for people with arthritis and joint pain because they don't get to move their arms too much.

Questions

What kind of device are trackball, joystick, and touchpad? Pointing devices
Which device supports multi-touch gestures like pinch-to-zoom, two-finger scrolling, tap-to-click, and three-finger swipes? Touchpad
Which pointing device is primarily designed for games and specific industrial applications? Joystick

What Are Screen Magnifiers Used For?

Screen magnifiers are tools that help people with low vision and other visual impairments better access digital content and the web.

Let's delve deeper into what these tools are and the role they play in digital content accessibility.

Screen magnifiers work by enlarging texts, graphics, and other elements on a computer or mobile device screen. Many screen magnifiers allow users to enlarge the display by more than 200%. Users can then navigate the page using their pointing device or keyboard. Additionally, most magnifiers offer customizable zoom percentages and other features in their settings.

Screen magnifiers primarily help people with low vision read text, as small fonts in documents or applications can be challenging for them. By enlarging the text, they can read emails, articles, and other content without straining their eyes. Screen magnifiers also assist with web browsing. They help users locate and click on buttons, links, and other interactive elements that might be difficult to see. This improved visibility ensures that users can browse websites, fill out forms, and engage in online activities without difficulty.

Therefore, software developers need to make their digital products accessible to people with low vision. Some considerations include:

Using scalable fonts so the user can resize the page without the layout breaking.
Ensuring the user interface adapts to different screen sizes through responsive design.
Using high-contrast color schemes and customizable colors.
Implementing a non-sticky and tiny navbar so users can still see content when using magnifiers.
Using regular HTML text instead of images of text.
Providing feedback directly next to the element that triggers it, and more.
All the mainstay Operating Systems have at least one magnifier built into them by their manufacturers:

macOS and iOS both have Zoom. You can turn it on on macOS by going to Settings, filter by Accessibility, and then click on "Zoom". Toggle the "Use keyboard shortcuts to zoom" option to enable it.
You can turn it on on iPhone through Settings > Accessibility > Zoom.
Android devices have Magnification. To turn it on, go to Settings > Special Function > Accessibility> Magnification. Since this may vary from device to device, you can search for "Magnification" on the settings homepage to access it.
Windows has Magnifier. You can use it by going to Settings > Ease of Access > Magnifier.
The magnifiers for Linux operating systems vary. It is either Zoom or Magnifier.
Apart from the ones built into operating systems, some useful third party screen magnifiers are:

ZoomText for Windows.
ClaroView for both macOS and Windows.
iZoom for Windows.
Zoomify - Screen Magnifier for macOS.
LunarPluse for Windows.
Loupe for macOS.
Questions

How do most screen magnifiers work? By enlarging the texts, graphics, and other elements on a computer or mobile device screen.
Which of these should a developer do to make their digital products friendly to screen magnifiers? Make their pages respond to different screen sizes.
Which of the following is a third-party screen magnifier? ZoomText

What Is Voice Recognition Software Used For?

Voice recognition software helps people with disabilities interact with computers and other digital devices. Let's discuss what voice recognition software is and the role it plays in digital inclusion.

In the context of accessibility, voice recognition tools let people with disabilities use their voice to pass commands to perform various tasks instead of using traditional input devices like keyboards and mice. This includes writing emails and other documents, surfing the net, and controlling smart home devices.

Because voice recognition software tools eliminate the need for physical interaction, they empower people with disabilities with significant independence and control over their environment.

Here are the specific people who may find voice recognition software significantly helpful:

People with visual impairments, including those with low-vision or blindness.
Individuals with mobility impairments, such as limited use of hands and arms or conditions like arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome.
Those recovering from hand or arm injuries.
Individuals with cognitive disorders, like memory issues or attention deficit disorders.
Elderly individuals who might find it easier to use voice commands.
Note that people with disabilities are not the only ones who use voice recognition technology. Law enforcement agencies, gamers, drivers, and busy professionals also use voice recognition tools.

A few examples of voice recognition software that allows people to interact with their computer include Voice Control for macOS/iOS, Voice Access for Android, and Windows Speech Recognition for Windows (referred to as Voice Access in the most recent versions of Windows). Dragon by Nuance is a popular third-party voice recognition software for Windows.

Questions

What are the main input devices that voice recognition software replaces? Keyboards and mice.
Which of the following would be the least likely to benefit from voice recognition software? People with low leg movement.
Which of the following is not voice recognition software? Audacity.

What Are Some Common Accessibility Auditing Tools to Use?

Accessibility is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of digital content. When making your digital content accessible, it's important to ensure it meets accessibility standards.

An accessibility auditing tool is an application that helps you improve the accessibility of your digital content by reporting accessibility issues that can be easily found through automated testing. This content includes websites, web applications, and mobile apps.

It is important to note that while automated accessibility tools have a role in improving accessibility, they typically will only find about a third of all possible accessibility issues. Therefore, it is important not to rely on them entirely to evaluate the accessibility of your content. Manual testing, preferably by people with disabilities, will always be required to ensure that your content is as accessible as possible.

Let's look at some free tools that can help you improve the accessibility of your digital content.

Google Lighthouse is a popular web metric checker you can use directly within Chrome DevTools or online. This means you can check not only live websites but also locally-developed ones.

The metrics you can check include accessibility, SEO, best practices, and performance.

To use Lighthouse, open your DevTools by pressing F12 and switching to the Lighthouse tab. Select the metrics you want to check, choose the device you want to test on, and click the "Analyze page load" button.

An accessibility score will appear after the check is complete, along with a list of any issues that need fixing.

If you want more reliable metrics, consider using the web version. The downside is that it doesn't support testing local websites. You can access the web version on pagespeed.web.dev.

WAVE is another reliable accessibility checker you can use as a Chrome extension or on the web. All you need to do is enter the URL of your website and a comprehensive accessibility report will be generated for you. This report includes accessibility features implemented, ARIA, and contrasts.

The IBM Equal Accessibility Checker is another robust tool for improving digital content accessibility. With it, you can scan your websites for accessibility issues and generate a detailed report.

You can use it as a Chrome extension or Firefox add-on.

To use the IBM Accessibility Checker as a Chrome extension, download it from the Chrome web store. Open your Devtools by pressing F12 and selecting the "Accessibility Checker" tab located in the Elements panel. Click the scan button to start the check and a report will be generated for you. You can export the report as a spreadsheet and an HTML file by clicking the "Export XLS" button.

Please keep in mind, while these automated tools help you make your content more accessible, a perfect score from any of them does not mean that your content is entirely accessible. The range of issues that these tools test for is limited, and manual testing will always be needed to ensure a more accessible experience for everyone.

Questions

Which of these best describes an accessibility auditing tool? It evaluates how accessible your digital content is.
Which of these describes how you can use the IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker? It can be used as a Chrome extension, Firefox addon, or NPM package.
Which of these is a limitation of using the web version of the tool on Google Lighthouse? It cannot test local websites.

How Does Proper Heading Level Structure Affect Accessibility?

You previously learned about proper heading level structure. Now, you will learn how a good heading structure affects accessibility.

Proper use of headings creates a visual hierarchy for users to navigate and understand your web page. Using a logical heading hierarchy allows screen reader users to understand the structure of your content and navigate your content quickly. Creating appropriate heading text that accurately describes the content that follows helps everyone find the information they need on your site. As an additional benefit, well-formed headings may also improve the SEO of your site.

Here is a basic example:

<h1> Music Store Page</h1>

<h2>Featured Albums</h2>
<p>Check out our featured albums below:</p>
Think of headings as the foundation of your site. Without a good foundation, the accessibility of your content will suffer.

Let's look at how you can make your web projects friendly for people who use assistive technologies by using headings correctly.

Headings, ranging from h1 to h6, create a navigational structure for screen reader users. Screen readers can list all headings on a page, allowing users to jump directly to the sections they need. So, correctly arranging headings is important for helping these users avoid unnecessary content and finding the information they are looking for quickly.

<h1>I am an h1 heading</h1>
<h2>I am an h2 heading</h2>
<h3>I am an h3 heading</h3>
<h4>I am an h4 heading</h4>
<h5>I am an h5 heading</h5>
<h6>I am an h6 heading</h6>
People with partial sight or cognitive disabilities need to process information quickly and easily to reduce cognitive load.

While proper arrangement of headings is important, it is also necessary to make heading texts clear and descriptive.

Here are some key practices to follow to use headings properly:

Use headings in a hierarchy that reflects clear organization. For example, the page title should be an h1, major sections should be introduced with h2 headings, subsections with h3 , and so on, down to h6.
Don't skip from h1 to h3, or from h2 to h4, and so on.
Use clear and descriptive text that summarizes the content that follows each heading.
Don't use a heading in isolation – some content must follow the heading.
Use appropriate headings where necessary instead of formatting text to look like headings.
Each page should have a single h1 element representing the main topic or title.
Here's a basic markup that represents how you should use headings on a page:

<!-- Page title -->
<h1>What is HTML</h1>

<!-- First section -->
<section>
  <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
  <p>
    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language for
    creating web pages.
  </p>
</section>
<!-- Second section -->
<section>
  <h2>History of HTML</h2>
  <p>HTML began to take shape in the early 90s</p>
  <h3>Origins</h3>
  <p>
    HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. It has evolved significantly
    over the years.
  </p>
</section>
Questions

How does proper heading structure help those using screen readers? It allows screen readers to navigate and skip to different sections easily.
Why is it important to use headings properly for users who rely on keyboards? It lets users jump between sections without the need to tab through every link.
Which of these is one of the best practices for using headings on a web page? Using clear and descriptive texts that summarize the following content.

Working with Accessible tables and forms

What Are Best Practices for Tables and Accessibility?

When we see a table, we immediately start making visual associations between the data and the headers.

For example, let's say we have a table representing our pets. We have two dogs and two cats and the table is showing us their names and ages. While a sighted person may be able to understand the relationships in this table, making the connections between the values and the headers is much harder for people who use screen readers to navigate the table.

As a web developer, you are in charge of creating these associations and structuring your HTML markup in a way that is also easy for screen reader users to interpret.

So, let's see how you can create accessible tables that everyone can understand. The first best practice that we will cover is using table caption. With the caption element, you can write the caption (or title) of a table, so users, especially those who use assistive technologies, can quickly understand the table's purpose and content. You should place the caption element immediately after the opening tag of the table element. This way, screen readers and other assistive technologies can provide more context by announcing the caption before reading the content.

<table>
  <caption>Our Pets</caption>
  <!-- Table Rows and Columns -->
</table>
Now let's talk about row and column headers. Headers are special cells, typically found at the start of a row or column, that describe the type of data stored in the row or column. You can define a row or column header with the table header element, th.

For example, the code below creates a table for two pets. Every row has a row header (the name of the pet) and every column has a column header, which describes what the data in the column represents (age and type).

<table>
  <caption>Our Pets</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <!-- Column Headers -->
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Age</th>
      <th>Type</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Nora</th> <!-- Row Header -->
      <td>5</td>
      <td>Dog</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Gino</th> <!-- Row Header -->
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Cat</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
Notice that the above code has a caption element immediately after the opening table element. Then, inside the table head (thead) element, it has the column headers (Name, Age, and Type). In the second and third rows, inside the table body (tbody) element, we find the data for each one of our pets. The names of the pets are the row headers because they are inside table header elements (th).

Associating the data cells with their corresponding headers is also very important for screen readers. The scope attribute determines if a header is a row header or a column header. Screen readers may guess this correctly from the table's structure, but it's usually recommended to explicitly indicate the scope to ensure clarity.

The scope attribute has four possible values. The two you will use most often are col for column and row for row. In the code below, you can see that we added the scope attribute to the column and row headers. The three column headers (Name, Age, and Type) have a scope of col, column.

The two row headers (Nora and Gino) have a scope of row.

<table>
  <caption>Our Pets</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <!-- Now they have scope -->
      <th scope="col">Name</th>
      <th scope="col">Age</th>
      <th scope="col">Type</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Nora</th>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>Dog</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Gino</th>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Cat</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
If a column or row header spans across multiple cells, the scope will also be applied to each one of the cells individually. Here's an example of that:

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <th scope="col">Name</th>
      <th scope="col">Age</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th rowspan="2" scope="row">Dogs</th>
      <th scope="row">Nora</th>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Gino</th>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th rowspan="2" scope="row">Cats</th>
      <th scope="row">Lulu</th>
      <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Elizabeth</th>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
In this table, the cell with Nora's age (5) will have one column header (Age) and two row headers (Dogs and Nora). Gino's age (2) will also have one column header (Age) and two row headers (Dogs and Gino).

However, some screen readers may not be able to interpret tables with complex structures, so you should also try to flatten the table as much as possible to avoid row and column headers that span across multiple cells.

Your goal should always be to make sure users can access this information, even if their screen readers can handle complex table structures.

Now, for cell width, it's recommended to avoid using fixed values. You should use relative values instead, like percentages. Also, try to avoid defining cell height. This will allow users to adjust the text size to fit their needs.

And finally, you should let the browser determine the table width whenever possible, to reduce the need for horizontal scrolling.

HTML tables are essential for presenting structured data in an accessible and understandable format. By following these accessibility guidelines, you can create tables that are easy to understand for everyone.

Why Is It Important for Inputs to Have an Associated Label?

Labels on input fields might seem like small details, but they play a crucial role in making forms easier for everyone to use.

Labels help people with disabilities, make forms more user-friendly for everyone, and ultimately improve form conversion rates.

Let's dive into why adding labels to input elements is important for accessibility and usability.

Screen readers often rely on labels to describe the purpose of input fields. In order for this to work properly, the label must be programmatically associated with the input. While there are several ways to do that, the most common is to use the HTML label element.

Here's how to associate a label with an input:

<form>
   <label for="name">Your Name</label>
   <input type="text" id="name" />
</form>
In this example, the for attribute of the label element is associated with the id of the input element. This connection allows screen readers to announce the label when the input is in a focused state, allowing screen reader users to understand the purpose of the input.

Associating labels with all input fields also benefits SEO. With proper labels, search engines will understand the page content better, leading to a positive impact on the page search rankings.

But it is important to understand that you're making content for humans, not search engines. So, you should make sure the labels are as clear and descriptive as possible.

Questions

Why is adding labels to input elements important for accessibility? They help screen readers describe the purpose of input fields.
What is the correct way to programmatically associate a label with an input in HTML? Set the label's for attribute to match the input's id.
Besides accessibility, what is another benefit of associating labels with inputs? It can help search engines better understand the page content.

Introduction to ARIA

What Is the Purpose of WAI-ARIA, and How Does It Work?

Making static content accessible can be relatively straightforward, but dynamic content can be more challenging. This is where WAI-ARIA comes in.

Let's look at what WAI-ARIA is, its purpose, how it works, and some examples.

WAI-ARIA stands for Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications. It's a specification that enhances accessibility for dynamic content and UI (User Interface) components.

Note that WCAG and WAI-ARIA are not the same. WCAG provides general guidelines for web accessibility, while WAI-ARIA offers specific rules for making dynamic and interactive content accessible for users of assistive technologies.

So, the primary purpose of WAI-ARIA is to improve accessibility for dynamic content and UI components that do not have native HTML equivalents.

WAI-ARIA works by introducing a set of attributes you can add to HTML elements to provide additional semantic information. These attributes are categorized into roles, states, and properties.

ARIA role defines the purpose of an element within a website or web app. Here is an example of setting the role to button for a div element.

<div role="button">Click Me</div>
By doing this you are indicating to assistive technology that the element is a button. Roles do not provide any functionality however. Merely giving this div a role of button will not make it act like a button. To make it look and behave like a button you would need to use CSS and JavaScript to get the desired result.

Here is an example of using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a custom button element.

NOTE: Don't worry about trying to understand the CSS and JavaScript code. You will learn those languages in future modules.

<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
<div id="custom-btn" role="button">Click Me</div>
<script src="index.js"></script>
#custom-btn {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 0.4em 1em;
  font-size: 1rem;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  color: buttontext;
  background-color: buttonface;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
  user-select: none;
  text-align: center;
}

#custom-btn:focus {
  outline: 2px solid Highlight;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}

#custom-btn:active {
  background-color: #ddd;
}
const button = document.getElementById("custom-btn");

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});

button.addEventListener("keydown", (e) => {
  if (e.key === "Enter" || e.key === " ") {
    e.preventDefault(); 
    button.click();
  }
});
It is always better to use the native button or input element with type="button" instead.

ARIA properties provide additional details about elements. For example, the aria-labelledby property lets you connect an element to a specific label:

<h2 id="header-id">About freeCodeCamp</h2>
<button id="button-id" aria-labelledby="header-id button-id">Learn More</button>
This will make the elements understandable and navigable for users of assistive technologies.

To get the best out of WAI-ARIA, try to stick with native HTML whenever possible since it generally provides more accessibility out of the box.

Use WAI-ARIA only when HTML falls short, and don’t forget to test with assistive technologies like screen readers, or have people with disabilities test your work. Also, make sure your WAI-ARIA states and properties update with the content in real time. Avoid overusing ARIA, as it can often be confusing.

What Are ARIA Roles?

NOTE: Some of these interactive examples might include CSS and JavaScript code. Don't worry about trying to understand the code. The previews are there to help illustrate some of the main points discussed in the lesson. To see the previews, you will need to enable the interactive editor.

ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications.

ARIA roles specify the semantic meaning of HTML elements. They're essential for making web content accessible to people who use assistive technologies, like screen readers.

HTML has semantic and non-semantic elements, based on whether they convey meaning about their content.

Many semantic HTML elements already have an ARIA role assigned by default. For example, the button element has a default ARIA role of button.

<button>Example button</button>
But non-semantic elements don't have a role. For example, screen readers will not know how to interpret the purpose of a div if you don't specify its role explicitly.

<div>
  <!-- more elements go here -->
</div>
To specify the ARIA role of an element, you just need to add the role attribute, like this role="ARIA role", where value is the name of a role in the ARIA specification.

Here is an example of using the role attribute with a value of "alert":

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

<div class="alert" id="exp-warning" role="alert">
  <span class="hidden">Your log in session will expire in 3 minutes.</span>
</div>
.alert {
  background-color: #fff3cd;
  border: 1px solid #ffeeba;
  color: #856404;
  padding: 1em;
  margin-top: 1em;
  border-radius: 4px;
  font-weight: bold;
}

.alert span {
  display: inline-block;
}
It is important to note that specifying a role on an element only does one thing: It informs assistive technology of the purpose of the element. It does not add any functionality or behavior to the element. If people expect a role to behave a certain way, it is up to you, the developer, to add that expected behavior.

For example, adding a role of button to a div does not automatically make it clickable with a mouse or usable with a keyboard. It is the responsibility of the developer to add the expected behavior that allows the div to act like a button, and in most cases, it is just better to use the button element.

There are six main categories of ARIA roles:

Document structure roles
Widget roles
Landmark roles
Live region roles
Window roles
And Abstract roles
Let's take a look at them in more detail.

Document structure roles define the overall structure of the web page. With these roles, assistive technologies can understand the relationships between different sections and help users navigate the content.

However, most of the document structure roles are not used in modern web development because browsers already support equivalent semantic HTML elements, which should be prioritized whenever possible.

You should specify the roles that don't have an equivalent semantic element. For example: toolbar, tooltip, feed, math, presentation, none, and note.

There are other similar roles but these are the most commonly used ones. This is an example of a div with the math ARIA role. The div contains a mathematical equation.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

<div role="math" aria-label="x squared + y squared = 3">
  x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 3
</div>
.math-expression {
  font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  background-color: #f4f4f4;
  border-left: 4px solid #007acc;
  padding: 0.75em 1em;
  margin-top: 1em;
  display: inline-block;
}

.math-expression sup {
  font-size: 0.8em;
}
You'll also notice that the div has an aria-label attribute. The value of this attribute should be a string that represents the expression.

Widget roles define the purpose and functionality of interactive elements, like scrollbars.

Examples of widget roles include scrollbar, searchbox, separator (when focusable), slider, spinbutton, switch, tab, tabpanel, and treeitem.

Here is an example of a searchbox:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

<div class="search-container" role="search">
  <label for="searchbox" class="visually-hidden">Search</label>

  <div
    id="searchbox"
    class="searchbox"
    role="searchbox"
    aria-label="Search the site"
    tabindex="0"
    contenteditable="true">
  </div>

  <button type="button" aria-label="Submit search">Search</button>
</div>

.search-container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 0.5em;
  margin-top: 1em;
}

.searchbox {
  flex: 1;
  padding: 0.5em;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 4px;
  font-size: 1em;
  min-height: 1.5em;
}

.searchbox:focus {
  border-color: #007acc;
  outline: none;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px rgba(0, 122, 204, 0.3);
}

button {
  padding: 0.5em 1em;
  background-color: #007acc;
  color: #fff;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #005fa3;
}

/* Hide visually but keep for screen readers */
.visually-hidden {
  position: absolute;
  left: -9999px;
}
Some of these roles have equivalent semantic elements. You should prioritize the semantic element over the role if there is one. For example, you should favor using the HTML button element over adding a role of button to a div.

Landmark roles classify and label the primary sections of a web page. Screen readers use them to provide convenient navigation to important sections of a page. You should use them sparingly to keep the overall layout simple and easy to understand. Examples of landmark roles are banner, complementary, contentinfo, form, main, navigation, region, and search. Each of these roles has a corresponding HTML equivalent, such as header, footer, aside, form, main, nav, section, and search. If you use the proper HTML elements to define the sections of your page then it is not necessary to explicitly add the role attribute to these elements.

Here is an example of a banner:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">


<div role="banner" class="site-banner">
  <h1>Accessible Web Design</h1>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Articles</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</div>
.site-banner {
  background-color: #007acc;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 1em 1.5em;
  border-radius: 4px;
}

.site-banner h1 {
  margin: 0 0 0.5em;
  font-size: 1.5em;
}

.site-banner nav ul {
  list-style: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  display: flex;
  gap: 1em;
}

.site-banner nav a {
  color: #fff;
  text-decoration: none;
  font-weight: 500;
}

.site-banner nav a:hover {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
Live region roles define elements with content that will change dynamically. This way, screen readers and other assistive technologies can announce changes to users with visual disabilities. These roles include: alert, log, marquee, status, and timer.

Here is an example of a status:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

<div class="status-demo">
  <button id="update-status-btn">Check Status</button>
  <div id="status-msg" role="status" class="status-message">
    No updates yet.
  </div>
</div>

<script src="index.js"></script>
.status-demo {
  margin-top: 1em;
}

button {
  padding: 0.5em 1em;
  background-color: #007acc;
  color: #fff;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #005fa3;
}

.status-message {
  margin-top: 0.75em;
  padding: 0.75em;
  background-color: #e8f4ff;
  border: 1px solid #b3d8ff;
  border-radius: 4px;
  font-weight: 500;
}
const button = document.getElementById("update-status-btn");
const statusMessage = document.getElementById("status-msg");

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  statusMessage.textContent = "Your upload has completed successfully.";
});
Window roles define sub-windows, like pop up modal dialogues. These roles include alertdialog and dialog. Please note that it is now considered a best practice to use the HTML dialog element and its associated JavaScript methods instead of manually creating a dialog.

Here is an example of using a dialog role for a custom dialog:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

<button id="open-dialog">Open Dialog</button>

<div id="custom-dialog" role="dialog" aria-modal="true" aria-labelledby="dialog-title" class="dialog">
  <div class="dialog-content">
    <h3 id="dialog-title">Confirm Action</h3>
    <p>Are you sure you want to delete this file?</p>
    <div class="dialog-actions">
      <button id="confirm-btn">Yes</button>
      <button id="close-dialog">Cancel</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<script src="index.js"></script>
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 2em;
}

button {
  padding: 0.5em 1em;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
  background-color: #007acc;
  color: white;
  font-size: 1em;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #005fa3;
}

.dialog {
  display: none;
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); 
  justify-content: center; 
  align-items: center;   
  z-index: 1000;
}

.dialog-content {
  background-color: white;
  padding: 1.5em;
  border-radius: 8px;
  width: 90%;
  max-width: 400px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}

.dialog-actions {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-end;
  gap: 0.5em;
  margin-top: 1em;
}
const dialog = document.getElementById("custom-dialog");
const openBtn = document.getElementById("open-dialog");
const closeBtn = document.getElementById("close-dialog");
const confirmBtn = document.getElementById("confirm-btn");

openBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  dialog.style.display = "flex";
});

closeBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  dialog.style.display = "none";
});

confirmBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("File deleted.");
  dialog.style.display = "none";
});
And finally, we have abstract roles. These roles help organize the document. They're only meant to be used internally by the browser, not by developers, so you should know that they exist but you shouldn't use them on your websites or web applications.

With ARIA roles, you can create accessible and inclusive websites and web applications. They provide semantic information about the purpose and function of HTML elements.

Screen readers and other assistive technologies use this information to help users understand the content of your page and set expectations for how to use it, which helps ensure that everyone can have a great user experience.

What Are the Roles of the aria-label and aria-labelledby Attributes?

It is important to make sure that all users, including those living with disabilities, can access websites without issues.

For people using screen readers, the aria-label and aria-labelledby attributes provide crucial information about page elements that might be unclear or invisible.

Let's look at what the aria-label and aria-labelledby attributes are and the roles they play in making the web accessible to people with visual impairments and related disabilities.

You'll notice both aria-label and aria-labelledby are prefixed with aria. So what does that mean? ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. It's a set of attributes prefixed with aria-, which lets developers communicate the purpose of elements to assistive technologies. The aria-label attribute is an invisible label for interactive elements. It adds a text label to an element that screen readers can read.

aria-label is especially useful for elements that do not have visible text but still need to be described by screen readers. For example, buttons with only icons often need aria-label to convey their purpose.

Here is an example:

<button aria-label="Search">
  <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i>
</button>
In this case, a screen reader may announce this button as Search, button, even though the button only contains an icon. The aria-label attribute tells screen readers what text to use in place of the icon.

If the button contained the text "Search" instead of an icon, then there would be no need for the aria-label attribute as the text would provide the label for the button.

For input elements, the aria-label attribute provides a label directly if there isn't a visible label associated with the input.

The aria-labelledby attribute does the exact same thing as the aria-label attribute, but instead of defining the text directly in the attribute, you use a reference to text that already exists on the page. The existing text must have an id attribute, which will be used for the reference value in the aria-labelledby attribute.

Here's an example:

<input type="text" aria-labelledby="search-btn">
<button type="button" id="search-btn">Search</button>
In this case, the text for the button is being used as the label for the search input. Screen readers will announce the input as something like Search, edit. If you later decide you want to change the button text to Find, the label for the input will automatically be updated to the new text since it is referencing the button text. Combining multiple id values into a single aria-labelledby attribute value is also possible. Here's how that works:

<div>
  <span id="volume-label">Volume</span>
  <span id="volume-details">Adjust the volume level</span>
  <input
    type="range"
    min="0"
    max="100"
    value="30"
    aria-labelledby="volume-label volume-details">
</div>
For the slider, the screen reader will look out for the content of the volume-label and volume-details elements and announce Volume Adjust the volume level.

You've seen that both aria-label and aria-labelledby attributes help screen readers understand what elements do. So, which one should you use? Since they both provide the same functionality, either can be used, but there may be a few advantages to using aria-labelledby over aria-label:

If someone is using a translation service to translate the content on your page, the text in an aria-label attribute may not always be translated.
Using aria-labelledby can also help prevent a mismatch between the visible label text and the invisible label for screen reader users since updating the visible text will automatically update the invisible label.
aria-labelledby can make it much easier to programmatically create complex invisible labels consisting of multiple sources of text.
One last note, do not use aria-label and aria-labelledby on an element at the same time. In this case, the invisible label for screen readers will always be determined by aria-labelledby and aria-label will be completely ignored.

Questions

What does ARIA stand for? Accessible Rich Internet Applications.
What do both aria-label and aria-labelledby do? They provide labels for elements to enhance accessibility for screen readers.
When should you use aria-labelledby over aria-label? When there is existing visible text on the page that can be used as a label.

**************************************************************************************************************************

What Is the aria-hidden Attribute, and How Does It Work?
If you ever need to display content while at the same time hiding it from people who use assistive technology, like screen readers, you can use the aria-hidden attribute.

You just need to add it to the HTML element that you want to hide and set its value to true, like you can see over here: aria-hidden="true".

This attribute hides the element and all of its children from the accessibility tree, while keeping them visible on the page. Common use cases include:

Icons and images that only have a decorative purpose.
Duplicated content.
It is important to remember that aria-hidden only hides content from assistive technology, such as screen readers. If the content should be hidden from everyone, then you should not use aria-hidden to hide it. For example, a hamburger menu that is currently collapsed must be hidden from all keyboard users, not just screen reader users. In this case you could set the CSS display property to none on the menu to remove it from the DOM when it is collapsed.

You should never use aria-hidden to hide an element that is focusable with the keyboard. The aria-hidden attribute only removes the element from the accessibility tree. It does not remove it from the DOM. Thus, it will still be possible for screen reader users to tab to the element, but their screen reader will not announce the element, effectively causing them to focus on "nothing".

Here's an example where we hide an icon from the accessibility tree by adding the aria-hidden attribute with a value of true.

We only keep the text exposed to assistive technologies to avoid any confusion that may arise from the redundancy of having both an icon and text for the same purpose.

NOTE: This interactive example includes the Font Awesome CDN so you can see the gear icon displayed in the preview window. To see the previews, you will need to enable the interactive editor.

<head>
  <!-- Font Awesome CDN -->
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free@6.5.0/css/all.min.css"
  />
</head>

<button>
  <i class="fa-solid fa-gear" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  <span class="label">Settings</span>
</button>
You do not need to use aria-hidden when:

The HTML element already has a hidden attribute.
The element or the element's ancestor is already hidden with display: none.
The element or the element's ancestor is already hidden with visibility: hidden.
In these three cases, the element is already removed from the DOM and thus hidden from the accessibility tree, so the aria-hidden attribute is not necessary.

As with using any ARIA attributes, you should always test with assistive technologies, and preferably having people with disabilities test your work, to make sure that it's easy to understand, even with these hidden elements.

You should also know that setting aria-hidden to false will not expose the element to assistive technologies if any of its parents has this attribute set to true.

The aria-hidden attribute is used to hide elements from people who use assistive technology, such as screen reader users.

While it can be helpful for hiding purely decorative elements and duplicated content, it should be used sparingly to avoid hindering accessibility.

In general, all content and functionality available on the page should also be available to people using assistive technology. The use case for aria-hidden is very narrow and should be limited primarily to making the experience cleaner for screen reader users by removing purely decorative or duplicate information. Do not use aria-hidden to hide content that you don’t think screen reader users would be interested in. Screen reader users deserve to have access to all information on the page.

By following these best practices and testing the user experience, you can create inclusive online experiences for everyone.

Questions

What is the primary purpose of the aria-hidden attribute? To hide elements from assistive technologies.
When should the aria-hidden attribute be used? For decorative elements that do not contribute to the main content.
What are the potential risks of overusing the aria-hidden attribute? Hindered accessibility for users with disabilities.

**************************************************************************************************************************

What Is the aria-describedby Attribute, and How Does It Work?

The aria-describedby attribute is used to provide additional information about an element to screen reader users by referencing existing content on the page. It creates a programmatic association between the element and the content (technically referred to as an accessible description), which screen readers can use to inform users of the additional information when they interact with the element.

The most common use for aria-describedby is to associate instructions and error messages with form inputs. Due to the various methods screen reader users have for navigating a page, they may miss these messages when navigating between inputs. Using aria-describedby helps ensure that they will hear them.

Let's take a look at a few examples to understand how it works. In this first example, we have a form element that accepts a password.

Enable the interactive editor and type a few characters into the password input field. You will see that the password is masked in the preview window. You should also see that the password-help text remains red until you provide 8 or more characters into the input.

NOTE: This interactive example is using CSS and JavaScript to dynamically update the color for the password-help text. Don't worry about trying to understand the JavaScript code because you will learn JavaScript in future modules.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

<form>
  <label for="password">Password:</label>
  <input type="password" id="password" aria-describedby="password-help" />
  <p id="password-help">Your password must be at least 8 characters long.</p>
</form>

<script src="index.js"></script>
#password-help {
  color: red;
}
const passwordEl = document.getElementById("password");
const passwordHelpText = document.getElementById("password-help");

passwordEl.addEventListener("input", (e) => { 
  const userInput = e.target.value;
  passwordHelpText.style.color = userInput.length >= 8 ? "green" : "red";
});
We are using a label element for the Password text and associating that with the password input field.

We also have a paragraph element that describes the password requirements. We are using the aria-describedby attribute to associate the password input field with the password requirements in the paragraph element. When a screen reader user interacts with this input, their screen reader will announce the name of the input (Password) and may then also announce the password requirements. This is not an absolute guarantee however as some screen readers may not automatically announce the additional content, or may only announce it in specific circumstances. This is not uncommon. Each screen reader is different and handles ARIA attributes in their own way. This does not negate the use of aria-describedby, as it will benefit screen reader users in general.

Another good use case for the aria-describedby attribute is when you have a delete button. Here is an example of a delete button followed by a message describing what will happen when the button is clicked:

<button aria-describedby="delete-message">Delete</button>

<p id="delete-message">Warning! All deletions are permanent.</p>
Just like in the earlier example, we associate the delete button with the message using the aria-describedby attribute. The id value and the value of the aria-describedby attribute must match.

The aria-describedby attribute is a powerful attribute that can be used to help ensure that additional information about an element is provided to screen reader users when they interact with the element. It is most commonly used to associate instructions and error messages with form inputs in order to reduce the chance that screen reader users will miss these messages as they navigate the form.

Questions

What is the purpose of the aria-describedby attribute in HTML? To provide additional information about an element to assistive technologies.
In the examples provided, how does the aria-describedby attribute enhance the user experience for form fields? It associates additional descriptive text with form fields to provide more context or instructions.
Which of the following is the correct way to use the aria-describedby attribute inside of a form? 
<form>
  <label for="password">Password:</label>
  <input type="password" id="password" aria-describedby="password-help" />
  <p id="password-help">Your password must be at least 8 characters long.</p>
</form>

Working with Accessible Media Elements

When Is the alt Attribute Needed, and What Are Some Examples of Good Alt Text?

Alternative text, often abbreviated as alt text, is a brief text description of an image. It provides essential information about the image for users who cannot see it, such as people who use screen readers and other assistive technologies.

It's essential for making websites accessible to people with visual disabilities.

Alternative text is also used by search engines to understand images. Some browsers may also display it when an image is not loaded properly. This can happen when the image file is missing or when the user has connectivity issues. So it's helpful for many different purposes.

A person with a visual disability will not be able to know what's in the image unless it's described in the alt text. An example of bad alt text for an image of a puppy would be "A cute puppy."

This text is not specific enough to convey the important details of the image, like what does the puppy look like? Where is the puppy? Are there any important objects around the puppy?

Let's improve this. An example of good alternative text would be: "A black and white puppy with an orange collar lies on its belly in the sand, looking off to the side. A bright orange ball rests near its front paws."

Here you can see this in HTML with an image element, the alt attribute, and a more detailed description:

Example Code
<img src="puppy.png" alt="A black and white puppy with an orange collar lies on its belly in the sand, looking off to the side. A bright orange ball rests near its front paws." />
It is important to note that there is no one correct way to write alt text for an image. What you include in your description will depend on the context the picture is used in. For example, if the puppy picture was on a website about dog breeds, you might want to include more specifics about the physical description of the puppy and possibly ignore the fact that the puppy is at the beach playing with an orange ball. Ultimately, the alt text you use for an image should reflect the primary purpose for including the image on the page, and the information you provide should give people who can't see the image the necessary details to understand that purpose.

Here we have another example of a beautiful tropical resort. Let's describe it.

An example of bad alt text for this image would be "Resort."

This is too short and it doesn't provide enough information about the image. To improve this description, you could expand it to include the most important elements of the image:

"Tropical resort featuring a swimming pool surrounded by palm trees and bungalows."

You can use the alt attribute in HTML like this:

Example Code
<img src="resort.png" alt="Tropical resort featuring a swimming pool surrounded by palm trees and bungalows." />
Now that you know what makes good and bad alt text, let's see some of the best practices.

You should try to keep alt text short. It should be detailed enough to understand the image but not so long that it becomes confusing.
You should not try to describe every little detail. Focus on the most important aspects of the image.
Generally, you don't need to start with "image of" or "picture of." You can just start the description directly.
Also, if there's similar text around the image, you don't need to write it again.
It's usually recommended to end the alt text with a period for consistency.
If the image is a link to another page, instead of describing the image itself, the alt text should describe what will happen if users click on it.
For example, if your website has a right arrow icon that takes the user to the next page, instead of writing an alt text that only says "right arrow", like in this example, where you can see the alt attribute with this description:

Example Code
<a href="about.html">
  <img src="arrow-right.png" alt="Right arrow." />
</a>
You should write something like this instead, where the alt text describes what will happen if users clicks on the image. They will go to the next page.

Example Code
<a href="about.html">
  <img src="arrow-right.png" alt="Go to next page." />
</a>
Only images that convey important information should have alt text. If an image is only used for decorative purposes, it should have null (empty) alt text, so it can be ignored by screen readers and other assistive technologies.

Here is an example of an empty alt attribute is empty:

Example Code
<img src="decorative_image.jpg" alt="" />
Every image on your website should have an alt attribute, even if it's empty. If you omit the alt attribute completely, some screen readers will read the file name instead, which can be distracting for people who use assistive technologies, so this is not recommended.

Finally, before your website is live, you should carefully test if screen readers can read the alt text correctly.

Writing effective alt text is essential for creating accessible web content. As a web developer, by providing clear descriptions of your images, you can make sure that everyone can engage with your website in an inclusive online experience.

Questions

What is the purpose of alt text in an image? To describe the image for people with visual disabilities.
When is it appropriate to leave the alt text empty for an image? When the image is purely decorative.
What should be the primary focus of the alt text for an image that acts as a link? Indicating the link's destination.

What Are the Accessibility Benefits for Good Link Text, and What Are Examples of Good Link Text?
Let's take a look at the benefits of writing good link texts in the context of accessibility, and some examples of good link texts.

The first visible benefit of a good link text is that it makes it easier for everyone to find information quickly. Descriptive links help users know where they're headed and what they'll access. This ensures the user doesn't feel lost and improves the overall user experience.

For those using screen readers, a clear and descriptive link text is a must. Screen readers read the link text aloud, so a text like "Read our accessibility guide" is way better than "Click here."

Making link text clear and descriptive isn't just beneficial for those living with visual impairments. Descriptive links also help people with cognitive disabilities by providing clear context.

Here are some best practices to keep in mind while writing link texts:

Make sure links are visually distinct by using underlining and other visual cues, so users can easily identify and navigate them.
Avoid generic link texts like "here", "click here", and "more-info" as they don't provide any useful information.
Aim for concise and descriptive link texts, ideally between 2-5 words, that convey the link's purpose.
Avoid jargon and abbreviations that users may not understand.
Focus on the destination, not the action. For example, "user behavior results", instead of "click here to read more".
Don’t repeat the same link text for different destinations.
Place links in a way that they make sense within the surrounding text. For example, "for more details, visit our events page" instead of "Click here for more".
Here are some examples of good link texts for specific use cases, compared to less helpful ones. Let's say you want to link to a page providing details about an event like this:

Example Code
<a href="webinar-details-link">Details</a>
Details is vague and doesn’t provide specific information about what the user will find if they click the link. Without additional context, users might not know if the link leads to details about a webinar, a product, a policy, or something else.

Now, here is an example of good link text:

Example Code
<a href="webinar-details-link">
  Get details about our upcoming webinar
</a>
This link text gives users context about the content they will find, making it easier to decide whether they want to click on it. It reduces ambiguity by specifying that the link is related to a webinar.

Here is an another example linking to a post in a blog:

Example Code
<a href="/blog-post-link">Read more</a>
The link text Read more is not ideal in terms of accessibility because it lacks context.

Here is a better link text example:

Example Code
<a href="/blog-post-link">
   Read our latest blog post on web accessibility
</a>
This updated link text provides users with a clearer idea of what to expect and why they might want to click the link, which is particularly important for those using screen readers.

Let's take a look at one more example. Let's say you want to provide more information about a certain topic:

Example Code
<a href="/link-to-topic">More info</a>
More info is also vague and can be problematic for accessibility. It doesn't provide specific details about the link's destination, which can be confusing for users relying on screen readers or those who might be navigating the site in a non-linear way.

Here is a better example for link text:

Example Code
<a href="/link-to-topic">
   Learn more about our accessibility efforts
</a>
This updated link text is better because it clearly describes what the user will find if they click the link. Users can immediately understand that the link leads to information about your accessibility efforts.

Questions

What Are Good Ways to Make Audio and Video Content Accessible?

Multimedia, especially video, has become the go-to format for sharing information online.

With this surge in content, there's a growing need to ensure everyone can access and enjoy video and audio content online, irrespective of their abilities or environment.

Making your audio and video content accessible isn't just a nice-to-have, it's essential for reaching a wider audience. Let's look at some inexpensive ways to make your video and audio content more accessible.

A video is not just about visuals but also audio, so the first thing you should consider doing is adding captions or subtitles to your video content.

Captions provide the text version of spoken words and important non-verbal sounds, like music or laughter, synchronized with the video.

Subtitles on the other hand are essential for people who don't understand the language you're speaking. This helps not only people who are deaf or hard of hearing but also those watching videos in noisy or quiet environments.

To add captions or subtitles to your video or audio content, you can use the track element inside your video or audio element:

<video
  width="400"
  height="300"
  controls
  src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/what-is-the-map-method-and-how-does-it-work.mp4"
>
  <track
    src="captions.vtt"
    kind="captions"
    srclang="en"
    label="English"
  />
</video>

<audio controls src="sample.mp3">
  <track
    src="captions.vtt"
    kind="captions"
    srclang="en"
    label="English"
  />
</audio>
The kind attribute is used to tell the track element how it should be used. Valid values for the kind attribute include captions, subtitles, chapters, and metadata.

The srclang attribute represents the language for the track content. The label attribute is a descriptive title for the text track that browsers use to identify and display it in the list of available text tracks.

Another important thing to consider is providing a transcript for your audio and video content. A transcript is a text version of all the spoken words in your audio or video. Unlike captions, transcripts don’t need to be synchronized with the media. Transcripts are useful for deaf people and those hard of hearing. They're also beneficial for people who prefer reading instead of watching or listening. Transcripts also make your content searchable, allowing users to quickly find specific parts of your audio or video. If you have a video or audio on a website, you can simply add the transcript below the audio or video:

<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.mp3" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

<!-- Transcript -->
<h3>Transcript</h3>
<p>
  [Speaker 1]: Welcome to the tutorial on making accessible content
</p>
<p>
  [Speaker 2]: Today, we'll cover captions, transcripts, and more.
</p>

<!-- Rest of transcript -->
If you're publishing videos on a video-sharing platform like YouTube or Vimeo, they have automatic captions and transcripts for videos. But if you're not satisfied, you can use services like veed.io, Rev, Amara, and Descript.

Other ways to make your video and audio content accessible include:

Adding a sign language overlay for videos for deaf people and those hard of hearing.
Providing volume and speed controls.
Ensuring good contrast for on-screen text.
Offering multiple formats.
Questions

How are captions different from subtitles in video content? Captions include spoken words and non-verbal sounds, while subtitles are for viewers who don't understand the language.
How can you add captions or subtitles directly to your video or audio content in HTML? By using the track tag inside the video or audio element.
Why are transcripts important for audio and video content? Transcripts help make content accessible for deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals and allow for easy searching of specific content.

What Are Some Ways to Make Web Applications Keyboard Accessible?

Many users rely on keyboards instead of mice due to physical disabilities, repetitive strain injuries, or personal preference. This includes users of screen readers and those who may not have a working mouse. Keyboard accessibility ensures these users can navigate web applications effectively without barriers.

Let's look at some practical techniques you can employ to make web applications keyboard accessible.

Many users rely on the Tab key to move through interactive elements on a webpage. By default, browsers let users tab through elements like links, buttons, and form fields in the order they appear in the HTML. This is called the natural tab order.

Sometimes, you may want to adjust which elements are focusable or change their focus order. The tabindex attribute allows you do this.

Here is the basic syntax:

<element tabindex="number">Element Text</element>
The value of tabindex determines how the element behaves in keyboard navigation:

tabindex="0" adds the element to the natural tab order.

Tabbing will move focus from the button to the div, then to the link, following their order in the HTML.

Click anywhere in the whitespace of the preview window. Then use the Tab key to see the focus move between the different elements. To interact with the example, you will need to enable the interactive editor.

<button>First</button>
<div tabindex="0">Second</div>
<a href="#">Third</a>
tabindex="-1" makes an element focusable programmatically. This is useful for managing focus in elements that are not normally focusable, such as headings, containers, dialogs, or error messages:

<p tabindex="-1">Sorry, there was an error with your submission.</p>
In this example, the paragraph is not part of the normal tab order, so users cannot reach it by pressing the Tab key. However, if you set focus to this element via a script, the message will be brought to the user's attention. You'll learn more about this technique in JavaScript lessons.

When the tabindex is greater than 0 it sets a custom tab order. So elements with lower positive values are focused first.

In this example, tabbing will focus the input with tabindex="1" first, then 2, then 3, regardless of their order in the HTML.

<input tabindex="2">
<input tabindex="1">
<input tabindex="3">
Custom positive values are sometimes used in complex widgets, such as a toolbar where you want a specific navigation order. However, this approach is discouraged because it can make navigation confusing and hard to maintain, especially as the page grows or changes.

accesskey is another attribute you can use to make your web project keyboard accessible. It allows you to define a key that focuses on or activates a particular element.

Here is an interactive example you can try out following the suggestions below (enable the interactive editor first):

accesskey="s" assigns the key S to the Save button. On most browsers, pressing ALT + S (on Windows) and CTRL + Option + S (on Mac) will activate this button.
accesskey="c" sets the key C to the Cancel button, allowing users to activate it using ALT + C (Windows) and CTRL + Option + C (Mac).
accesskey="h" assigns the key H to the Home link, allowing users to navigate to the homepage using ALT + H (Windows) and CTRL + Option + H (Mac).
Please note that the exact key combination to activate the accesskey might vary depending on the browser and operating system. It's typically ALT + Specified Key on Windows and CTRL + Option + Specified Key on Mac.

<button accesskey="s">Save</button>
<button accesskey="c">Cancel</button>
<a href="index.html" accesskey="h">Home</a>
Another way to make the keyboard accessible in your apps is to make sure you provide clear focus indicators. If you feel the default browser focus indicator is not enough, you can override it by targeting the focus state of the element.

Here is an example of styling the focus state for a button element. Click anywhere in the whitespace of the preview window followed by pressing the Tab key to focus the button. To interact with the example, you will need to enable the interactive editor.

<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">

<button>Example button</button>
button:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #005fcc;
}
The outline property is used to define the outline around the element. This example sets the outline to a solid blue line with 2 pixels set for the thickness. The focus indicator should be styled in a way that makes it obvious which element currently has focus. In order to be accessible, the indicator must have a minimum color contrast of at least 3:1 with the background color it covers.

You should also avoid keyboard traps, which occur when a user cannot move focus away from a certain element in components like modals and popups.

Questions

Why is the tabindex property important when managing keyboard navigation on a webpage? It allows you to control the order in which elements are focused when using the tab key.
