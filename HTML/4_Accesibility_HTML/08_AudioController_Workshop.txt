Step 1
In this workshop, you will practice working with ARIA by building an accessible audio controller.

To start, add an h1 element with the text Audio Controls.

Step 2
Next, add a button element with the type attribute set to the value button.

The button element's text should be Play.

Step 3
Next, add a div element to contain all the elements for the volume control.

Inside the div element, nest a span element with an id attribute set to volume-label. Also, the text for the span element should be Volume.

The id will later be referenced by ARIA attributes so assistive technologies can identify this text as the label for the volume control.

Step 4
Now it is time to add another span element.

This span element should have an id attribute set to volume-description. Also, the text for this span element should be Adjust the sound level.

Similar to the previous span element, the id of this span will later be referenced by ARIA attributes so assistive technologies can identify this text as the description for the volume control.

Step 5
Next, you need to add an input element with the type attribute set to range to create the volume slider. Set the min attribute to 0, the max attribute to 100, and the value attribute to 50 to define the default volume level.

Step 6
As you recall from prior lessons, the aria-labelledby attribute is used when there is existing text on the page that can be used as a label. In this case, you have added the id attribute to your span elements which will now be used here.

Add an aria-labelledby attribute to the input element set to volume-label volume-description.

Step 7
Your accessible audio controller is almost complete but there is one last thing to add.

Add a button element with the type attribute set to button and with text Mute below the div element.

And with that change, you have completed this workshop!
